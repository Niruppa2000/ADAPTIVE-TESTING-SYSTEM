2,Social Science - History,Class 6,General Social Studies,General Social Studies - Class 6,3,"WHY STUDY HISTORY?
This year, in Class VI, you will read history. It is part of a bigger
group of subjects known as Social Science. Social Science helps
us understand the working of our social world. It tells us about
geography, the way the economy works, and the manner in which
social and political life is organised. Most parts of Social Science
other than history tell you about the world in the present. History
will help you understand how this present evolved. It will tell you
about the past of the present.
When we live in a society, we become used to the world around
us. We begin to take that world for granted. We forget that life
was not always the way we see it. Can you, for instance, imagine
a life without fire? Can you think of what it is to live in a society
where the cultivation of crops was unknown? Or, what it was to
live at a time when roads and railways did not exist, and yet
people travelled long distances? History can take us into these
pasts.
History in this sense is an adventure. It is a journey across
time and space. It transports us into another world, another age,
in which people lived differently. Their economy and society, their
beliefs and faiths, their clothes and food, their settlements and
buildings, their arts and crafts – everything was different. History
can open doors into such worlds.
You may shrug your shoulders and say “Why should we bother
about pasts that are no longer with us, pasts that have gone by?”
But history is not just about the past. It is about the present.
The society we live in has been fashioned by those who came
before us. The joys and sorrows of their daily lives, their attempt
to grapple with the problems of their time, their discoveries and
inventions, slowly transformed human societies. These changes
were often so gradual, so seemingly small, that their impact was
not noticed by people at that time. Only later, when we return to
the past, when we study history, can we begin to see how these
changes happened, and we can observe their long-term effect. By
reading history we can understand how the modern world has
emerged over long centuries of development.

about the vast wealth of plants in the surrounding
forests, and collected roots, fruits and other forest
produce for their food. They also hunted animals.

Physical Map of the Subcontinent
Now find the Sulaiman and Kirthar hills to the
northwest. Some of the areas where women and
men first began to grow crops such as wheat and
barley about 8000 years ago are located here.
People also began rearing animals like sheep, goat,
and cattle, and lived in villages. Locate the Garo
hills to the north-east and the Vindhyas in central
India. These were some of the other areas where

agriculture developed. The places where rice was
first grown are to the north of the Vindhyas.
Trace the river Indus and its tributaries
(tributaries are smaller rivers that flow into a
larger river). About 4700 years ago, some of the
earliest cities flourished on the banks of these
rivers. Later, about 2500 years ago, cities
developed on the banks of the Ganga and its
tributaries, and along the sea coasts.
Locate the Ganga and its tributary called the
Son. In ancient times the area along these rivers
to the south of the Ganga was known as Magadha
now lying in the state of Bihar. Its rulers were very
powerful, and set up a large kingdom. Kingdoms
were set up in other parts of the country as well.
Throughout, people travelled from one part of
the subcontinent to another. The hills and high
mountains including the Himalayas, deserts, rivers
and seas made journeys dangerous at times, but
never impossible. So, men and women moved in
search of livelihood, as also to escape from natural
disasters like floods or droughts. Sometimes men
marched in armies, conquering others’ lands.
Besides, merchants travelled with caravans or
ships, carrying valuable goods from place to place.
And religious teachers walked from village to
village, town to town, stopping to offer instruction
and advice on the way. Finally, some people
perhaps travelled driven by a spirit of adventure,
wanting to discover new and exciting places. All
these led to the sharing of ideas between people.
Why do people travel nowadays?
Look at Map 1 once more. Hills, mountains and
seas form the natural frontiers of the subcontinent.
While it was difficult to cross these frontiers, those
who wanted could and did scale the mountains
and cross the seas. People from across the frontiers
also came into the subcontinent and settled here.
Facing Page: This is a
map of South Asia
(including the present
countries of India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh,
Nepal, Bhutan and Sri
Lanka) and the
neighbouring countries
of Afghanistan, Iran,
China and Myanmar.
South Asia is often
called a subcontinent
because although it is
smaller than a continent,
it is very large, and is
separated from the rest
of Asia by seas, hills and
mountains.

over several hundreds of years.

Two of the words we often use for our country are
India and Bharat. The word India comes from the
Indus, called Sindhu in Sanskrit. Find Iran and
Greece in your atlas. The Iranians and the Greeks
who came through the northwest about 2500 years
ago and were familiar with the Indus, called it the
Hindos or the Indos, and the land to the east of
the river was called India. The name Bharata was
used for a group of people who lived in the north-
west, and who are mentioned in the Rigveda, the
earliest composition in Sanskrit (dated to about
3500 years ago). Later it was used for the country.

There are several ways of finding out about the
past. One is to search for and read books that
were written long ago. These are called
manuscripts, because they were written by hand
(this comes from the Latin word ‘manu’, meaning
hand). These were usually written on palm leaf,
or on the specially prepared bark of a tree known
as the birch, which grows in the Himalayas.
Over the years, many manuscripts were eaten
away by insects, some were destroyed, but many

have survived, often preserved in temples and
monasteries. These books dealt with all kinds of
subjects: religious beliefs and practices, the lives
of kings, medicine and science. Besides, there
were epics, poems, plays. Many of these were
written in Sanskrit, others were in Prakrit
(languages used by ordinary people) and Tamil.
We can also study inscriptions. These are
writings on relatively hard surfaces such as stone
or metal. Sometimes, kings got their orders
inscribed so that people could see, read and obey
them. There are other kinds of inscriptions as
well, where men and women (including kings and
queens) recorded what they did. For example,
kings often kept records of victories in battle.
Can you think of
the advantages of
writing on a hard
surface? And what
could have been
the difficulties?
There 
were
many 
other
things that were
made and used in
the past. Those
who study these
objects are called
archaeologists.
They study the
remains of buildings made of stone and brick,
paintings and sculpture. They also explore and
excavate (dig under the surface of the earth) to
find tools, weapons, pots, pans, ornaments and
coins. Some of these objects may be made of stone,
others of bone, baked clay or metal. Objects that
are made of hard, imperishable substances usually
survive for a long time.
An old inscription.
This inscription dates
to about 2250 years
ago, and was found in
Kandahar, present-day
Afghanistan. It was
inscribed on the orders
of a ruler named
Ashoka. You will read
about him in Chapter
8. When we write
anything, we use a
script. Scripts consist
of letters or signs.
When we read what is
written, or speak, we
use a language. This
inscription was
inscribed in two
different scripts and
languages, Greek (top)
and Aramaic (below),
which were used in this
area.

Archaeologists also look for bones — of animals,
birds, and fish — to find out what people ate in the
past. Plant remains survive far more rarely — if
seeds of grain or pieces of wood have been burnt,
they survive in a charred form. Do you think cloth
is found frequently by archaeologists?
Historians, that is, scholars who study the past,
often use the word source to refer to the information
found from manuscripts, inscriptions and
archaeology. Once sources are found, learning
about the past becomes an adventure, as we
reconstruct it bit by bit. So historians and
archaeologists are like detectives, who use all these
sources like clues to find out about our pasts.

Did you notice the title of this book, Our Pasts?
We have used the word ‘pasts’ in plural to draw
attention to the fact that the past was different for
different groups of people. For example, the lives
of herders or farmers were different from those of
kings and queens, the lives of merchants were
different from those of crafts persons, and so on.

different practices and customs in different parts

of the country. For example, today most people
living in the Andaman Islands get their own food
by fishing, hunting, and collecting forest produce.
By contrast, most people living in cities depend
on others for supplies of food. Differences such
as these existed in the past as well.
Besides, there is another kind of difference.
We know a great deal about kings and the battles
they fought because they kept records of their
victories. Generally, ordinary people such as
hunters, fishing folk, gatherers, farmers or
herders did not keep records of what they did.
While archaeology helps us to find out about their
lives, there is much that remains unknown.

means 2000 years after the birth of Christ. All

One of the most famous stories of decipherment comes from Egypt, a
country in north Africa where there were kings and queens about 5000
years ago.
Rosetta is a town on the north coast of Egypt, and here an inscribed
stone was found, which contained inscriptions in three different languages
and scripts (Greek, and two forms of Egyptian). Scholars who could read
Greek figured out that the names of kings and queens were enclosed in a
little frame, called a cartouche. They then placed the Greek and the Egyptian
signs side by side, and identified the sounds for which the Egyptian letters
stood. As you can see, a lion stood for L, and a bird for A. Once they knew
what the letters stood for, they could read other inscriptions as well.

We know about people who lived in the
subcontinent as early as two million years ago.
Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The
name comes from the way in which they got their
food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught
fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds,
leaves, stalks and eggs.
Hunter-gatherers moved from place to place.
There are many reasons for this.
First, if they had stayed at one place for a long
time, they would have eaten up all the available
plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would
have had to go elsewhere in search of food.
Second, animals move from place to place —
either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of
deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves.
That is why those who hunted them had to follow
their movements.

Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different
seasons. So, people may have moved from season
to season in search of different kinds of plants.
Fourth, people, plants and animals need water
to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and
rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial
(with water throughout the year) others are
seasonal. People living on their banks would have
had to go in search of water during the dry seasons
(winter and summer).

Archaeologists have found some of the things
hunter-gatherers made and used. It is likely
that people made and used tools of stone,
wood and bone, of which stone tools have
survived best.
Some of these stone tools were used to cut
meat and bone, scrape bark (from trees) and
hides (animal skins), chop fruit and roots. Some
may have been attached to handles of bone or
wood, to make spears and arrows for hunting.
Other tools were used to chop wood, which was
used as firewood. Wood was also used to make
huts and tools.
Stone tools may also
have been used for :
Left : Digging the ground
to collect edible roots.
Right : Stitching clothes

This is an old site with
caves and rock shelters.
People chose these
natural caves because
they provided shelter
from the rain, heat and

shelters are close to the
Narmada valley. Can
you think of why people
chose to live here?
Many of the caves in which these early people
lived have paintings on the walls. Some of the
best examples are from Madhya Pradesh and
southern Uttar Pradesh. These paintings show

Archaeologists have given lengthy names for the time that we are studying.
They call the earliest period the Palaeolithic. This comes from two Greek
words, ‘palaeo’, meaning old, and ‘lithos’, meaning stone. The name points
to the importance of finds of stone tools. The Palaeolithic period extends
from 2 million years ago to about 12,000 years ago. This long stretch of
time is divided into the Lower, Middle and Upper Palaeolithic. This long
span of time covers 99% of human history.
The period when we find environmental changes, beginning about
12,000 years ago till about 10,000 years ago is called the Mesolithic (middle
stone). Stone tools found during this period are generally tiny, and are
called microliths. Microliths were probably stuck on to handles of bone or
wood to make tools such as saws and sickles. At the same time, older
varieties of tools continued to be in use.
The next stage, from about 10,000 years ago, is known as the Neolithic.
What do you think the term Neolithic means?
We have also mentioned the names of some places. You will find the
names of many more places in later chapters. Very often, we use present-
day names of the places where people lived in the past, because we do not
know what they called them.

Around 12,000 years ago, there were major
changes in the climate of the world, with a shift
to relatively warm conditions. In many areas, this
led to the development of grasslands. This in turn
led to an increase in the number of deer, antelope,
goat, sheep and cattle, i.e. animals that survived
on grass.
Those who hunted these animals now followed
them, learning about their food habits and their
breeding seasons. It is likely that this helped
people to start thinking about herding and rearing
these animals themselves. Fishing also became
important.

This was also a time when several grain bearing
grasses, including wheat, barley and rice grew
naturally in different parts of the subcontinent.
Men, women and children probably collected
these grains as food, and learnt where they grew,
and when they ripened. This may have led them
to think about growing plants on their own. In
this way people became farmers.
People could also attract and then tame animals
by leaving food for them near their shelters. The
first animal to be tamed was the wild ancestor of
the dog. Later, people encouraged animals that
were relatively gentle to come near the camps
where they lived. These animals such as sheep,
goat, cattle and also the pig lived in herds, and
most of them ate grass. Often, people protected
these animals from attacks by other wild animals.
This is how they became herders.
Can you think of any reasons why the dog was
perhaps the first animal to be tamed?

Domestication
Domestication
Domestication
Domestication
Domestication
is the name given to the process in which people grow plants and look
after animals. Very often, plants and animals that are tended by people
become different from wild plants and animals. This is because people
select plants and animals for domestication. For example, they select
those plants and animals that are not prone to disease. They also select
plants that yield large-size grain, and have strong stalks, capable of
bearing the weight of the ripe grain.
Seeds from selected plants are
preserved and sown to ensure that
new plants (and seeds) will have the
same qualities.
Amongst animals, those that are
relatively gentle are selected for
breeding. As a result, gradually,
domesticated animals and plants
become different from wild animals
and plants. For example, the teeth
and horns of wild animals are usually much larger than those of
domesticated animals.
Look at these two sets of teeth. Which do you think belongs to a wild
pig and which to a domesticated one?
Domestication was a gradual process that took place in many parts
of the world. It began about 12,000 years ago. Virtually all the plant and
animal produce that we use as food today is a result of domestication.
Some of the earliest plants to be domesticated were wheat and barley.
The earliest domesticated animals include sheep and goat.

If you plant a seed, you will notice that it takes
some time to grow. This may be for several days,
weeks, months and in some cases years. When
people began growing plants, it meant that they
had to stay in the same place for a long time
looking after the plants, watering, weeding,
driving away animals and birds — till the
grain ripened. And then, the grain had to be
used carefully.

As grain had to be stored for both food and
seed, people had to think of ways of storing it. In
many areas, they began making large clay pots,
or wove baskets, or dug pits into the ground. Do
you think hunter-gatherers would have made and
used pots? Give reasons for your answer.

Animals multiply naturally. Besides, if they are
looked after carefully, they provide milk, which is
an important source of food, and meat, whenever
required. In other words, animals that are reared
can be used as a ‘store’ of food.
Apart from food, what are the other things that
could have been obtained from animals?

Turn to Map 2 (page13). You will notice a number
of blue squares. Each marks a site from where
archaeologists have found evidence of early
farmers and herders. These are found all over the
subcontinent. Some of the most important ones
are in the north-west, in present-day Kashmir,
and in east and south India.
To find out whether these sites were settlements
of farmers and herders, scientists study evidence
of plants and animal bones. One of the most
exciting finds includes remains of burnt grain.
(These may have been burnt accidentally or on
purpose). Scientists can identify these grains, and
so we know that a number of crops were grown in
different parts of the subcontinent. They can also
identify the bones of different animals.

which were dug into the ground, with steps leading
into them. These may have provided shelter in cold
weather. Archaeologists have also found cooking
hearths both inside and outside the huts, which
suggests that, depending on the weather, people
could cook food either indoors or outdoors.
Draw a pit house.
Stone tools have been found from many sites
as well. Many of these are different from the earlier
Palaeolithic tools and that is why they are called
Neolithic. These include tools that were polished
to give a fine cutting edge, and mortars and pestles
used for grinding grain and other plant produce.
Mortars and pestles are used for grinding grain
even today, several thousand years later. At the
same time, tools of the Palaeolithic types
continued to be made and used, and remember,
some tools were also made of bone.
New stone tools.
Many kinds of earthen pots have also been
found. These were sometimes decorated, and were
used for storing things. People began using pots
for cooking food, especially grains like rice, wheat
and lentils that now became an important part of

 Did things change everywhere and all at once?
Not quite. In many areas, men and women still
continued to hunt and gather food, and elsewhere
people adopted farming and herding slowly, over
several thousand years. Besides, in some cases
people tried to combine these activities, doing
different things during different seasons.

Find Mehrgarh on Map 2 (page13). This site is
located in a fertile plain, near the Bolan Pass,
which is one of the most important routes into
Iran. Mehrgarh was probably one of the places
where people learnt to grow barley and wheat,
and rear sheep and goats for the first time in this
area. It is one of the earliest villages that we know
about. At this site many animal bones were found.
Bones of wild animals such as the deer and pig,
and also bones of sheep and goat were found.
Other finds at Mehrgarh include remains of
square or rectangular houses. Each house had
four or more compartments, some of which may

animals, such as wild horses, aurochs (an older,
wild form of cattle), bison, woolly rhinoceros,
reindeer and bear, painted in bright colours.
These colours were made from minerals like
ochre or iron ore, and charcoal. It is possible that
these paintings were done on ceremonial occasions.

children called the haunted house.
“Look at the architecture!” said one of the men.

Very often, old buildings have a story to tell. Nearly
a hundred and fifty years ago, when railway lines
were being laid down for the first time in the
Punjab, engineers stumbled upon the site of
Harappa in present-day Pakistan. To them, it
seemed like a mound that was a rich source of
ready made, high quality bricks. So they carried
off thousands of bricks from the walls of the old
buildings of the city to build railway lines. Many
buildings were completely destroyed.
Then, about eighty years ago, archaeologists
found the site, and realised that this was one of
the oldest cities in the subcontinent. As this was
the first city to be discovered, all other sites from
where similar buildings (and other things) were
found were described as Harappan. These cities
developed about 4700 years ago.
Very often, old buildings are pulled down to
make way for new construction. Do you think it
is important to preserve old buildings?

Many of these cities were divided into two or more
parts. Usually, the part to the west was smaller
but higher. Archaeologists describe this as the
citadel. Generally, the part to the east was larger
but lower. This is called the lower town. Very often
walls of baked brick were built around each part.
The bricks were so well baked that they have
lasted for thousands of years. The bricks were
laid in an interlocking pattern and that made the
walls strong.
In some cities, special
buildings were constructed
on the citadel. For example,
in Mohenjodaro, a very
special 
tank, 
which
archaeologists call the Great
Bath, was built in this area.
This was lined with bricks,
coated with plaster, and
made water-tight with a layer
of natural tar. There were
steps leading down to it from
two sides, while there were
rooms on all sides. Water was
probably brought in from a
well, and drained out after
use. Perhaps important
people took a dip in this tank
on special occasions.
Other cities, such as
Kalibangan and Lothal had
fire altars, where sacrifices
may have been performed.
And 
some 
cities 
like
Mohenjodaro, Harappa, and
Lothal had elaborate store
houses.
These cities were found in
the Punjab and Sind in
Pakistan, and in Gujarat,
Rajasthan, Haryana and
the Punjab in India.
Archaeologists have found
a set of unique objects in
almost all these cities: red
pottery painted with
designs in black, stone
weights, seals, special
beads, copper tools, and
paralleled sided long stone
blades.

Generally, houses were either one or two storeys
high, with rooms built around a courtyard. Most
houses had a separate bathing area, and some
had wells to supply water.
Many of these cities had covered drains. Notice
how carefully these were laid out,
in straight lines. Although you
cannot see it, each drain had a
gentle slope so that water could flow
through it. Very often, drains in
houses were connected to those on
the streets and smaller drains led

A Harappan city was a very busy place.
There were people who planned the
construction of special buildings in the city.
These were probably the rulers. It is likely
that the rulers sent people to distant lands
to get metal, precious stones, and other
things that they wanted. They may have
kept the most valuable objects, such as
ornaments of gold and silver, or beautiful
beads, for themselves. And there were
scribes, people who knew how to write, who
helped prepare the seals, and perhaps
wrote on other materials that have not
survived.
Besides, there were men and women,
crafts persons, making all kinds of things
— either in their own homes, or in special
workshops. People were travelling to
distant lands or returning with raw
materials and, perhaps, stories. Many
terracotta toys have been found and
children must have played with these.

Let us look at some of the objects that were made
and found in Harappan cities. Most of the things
that have been found by archaeologists are made
of stone, shell and metal, including copper, bronze,
gold and silver. Copper and bronze were used to
make tools, weapons, ornaments and vessels.
Gold and silver were used to make ornaments
and vessels.
Perhaps the most striking finds are those of
beads, weights, and blades.
The Harappans also made seals out of stone.
These are generally rectangular (See illustration
on page 27) and usually have an animal carved
on them.
The Harappans also made pots with beautiful
black designs, such as the one
shown on page 6.
Was metal used in the villages

Was stone used to make
weights?
Cotton was probably grown
at Mehrgarh from about 7000
years ago. Actual pieces of
cloth were found attached

Many of the things that were produced were
probably the work of specialists. A specialist is a
person who is trained to do only one kind of work,
for example, cutting stone, or polishing beads, or
carving seals. Look at the illustration (page 28)
and see how well the face is carved and how
carefully the beard is shown. This must have been
the work of an expert crafts person.
Not everybody could have been a specialist. We

women and men may have been specialists.

Raw materials are substances that are either
found naturally (such as wood, or ores of metals)
or produced by farmers or herders. These are then
processed to produce finished goods. For example,
cotton, produced by farmers, is a raw material
that may be processed to make cloth. While some
of the raw materials that the Harappans used were
available locally, many items such as copper, tin,
gold, silver and precious stones had to be brought
from distant places.
The Harappans probably got copper from
present-day Rajasthan, and even from Oman in

Unlike stone or shell, that are found naturally,
faience is a material that is artificially produced.
A gum was used to shape sand or powdered
quartz into an object. The objects were then glazed,
resulting in a shiny, glassy surface. The colours
of the glaze were usually blue or sea green.
Faience was used to make beads, bangles,
earrings, and tiny vessels.

While many people lived in the cities, others living
in the countryside grew crops and reared animals.
These farmers and herders supplied food to crafts
persons, scribes and rulers in the cities. We know
from remains of plants that the Harappans grew
wheat, barley, pulses, peas, rice, sesame, linseed
and mustard.
A new tool, the plough, was used to dig the
earth for turning the soil and planting seeds. While
real ploughs, which were probably made of wood,
have not survived, toy models have been found.
As this region does not receive heavy rainfall, some
form of irrigation may have been used. This means
that water was stored and
supplied to the fields when the
plants were growing.
The Harappans reared cattle, sheep,
goat and buffalo. Water and pastures were
available around settlements. However, in the dry
summer months large herds of animals were
probably taken to greater distances in search of
grass and water. They also collected fruits like
A toy plough.
Today, in many farming
communities, only men
use the plough. We do
not know whether the
Harappans followed
such customs or not.

The city of Dholavira was located on Khadir Beyt
(also spelled as Bet) in the Rann of Kutch, where
there was fresh water and fertile soil. Unlike some
of the other Harappan cities, which were divided
into two parts, Dholavira was divided into three
parts, and each part was surrounded with massive
stone walls, with entrances through gateways.
There was also a large open area in the settlement,
where public ceremonies could be held. Other
finds include large letters of the Harappan script
that were carved out of white stone and perhaps
inlaid in wood. This is a unique find as generally
Harappan writing has been found on small
objects such as seals.
The city of Lothal stood beside a tributary of
the Sabarmati, in Gujarat, close to the Gulf of
Khambat. It was situated near areas where raw
materials such as semi-precious stones were
easily available. This was an important centre for
making objects out of stone, shell and metal.
There was also a store house in the city. Many
seals and sealings (the impression of seals on
clay) were found in this storehouse.

Seals may have been used to stamp bags or packets

Around 3900 years ago we find the beginning of
a major change. People stopped living in many of
the cities. Writing, seals and weights were no
longer used. Raw materials brought from long
distances became rare. In Mohenjodaro, we find
that garbage piled up on the streets, the drainage
system broke down, and new, less impressive
houses were built, even over the streets.
Why did all this happen? We are not sure. Some
scholars suggest that the rivers dried up. Others
suggest that there was deforestation. This could
have happened because fuel was required for
baking bricks, and for smelting copper ores.
Besides, grazing by large herds of cattle, sheep
and goat may have destroyed the green cover. In
some areas there were floods. But none of these
reasons can explain the end of all the cities.
Flooding, or a river drying up would have had an
effect in only some areas.

It appears as if the rulers lost control. In any
case, the effects of the change are quite clear.
Sites in Sind and west Punjab (present-day
Pakistan) were abandoned, while many people
moved into newer, smaller settlements to the east
and the south.
New cities emerged about 1400 years later. You

You may have heard about the Vedas. There are
four of them – the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda
and Atharvaveda. The oldest Veda is the Rigveda,
composed about 3500 years ago. The Rigveda
includes more than a thousand hymns, called
sukta or “well-said”. These hymns are in praise
of various gods and goddesses. Three gods are
especially important: Agni, the god of fire; Indra,
a warrior god; and Soma, a plant from which a
special drink was prepared.
These hymns were composed by sages (rishis).
Priests taught students to recite and memorise
each syllable, word, and sentence, bit by bit, with
great care. Most of the hymns were composed,
taught and learnt by men. A few were composed
by women. The Rigveda is in old or Vedic Sanskrit,
which is different from the Sanskrit you learn in
school these days.

Sanskrit is part of a family of languages known as Indo-European.
Some Indian languages such as Assamese, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri
and Sindhi; Asian languages such as Persian and many European
languages such as English, French, German, Greek, Italian and
Spanish belong to this family. They are called a family because they
originally had words in common.
Take the words ‘matr’ (Sanskrit), ‘ma’ (Hindi) and ‘mother’ (English).
Do you notice any similarities?
Other languages used in the subcontinent belong to different
families. For instance, those used in the north-east belong to the
Tibeto-Burman family; Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam belong
to the Dravidian family; and the languages spoken in Jharkhand and
parts of central India belong to the Austro-Asiatic family.
List the languages you have heard about and try and identify the
families to which they belong.
The books we use are written and printed. The
Rigveda was recited and heard rather than read.
It was written down several centuries after it was
first composed, and printed less than 200 years
ago.

You move like chariots to the sea, through the power of Indra. You are full of

The rivers: We, who are full of water, move along the path the gods have made
for us. Once we start flowing, we cannot be stopped. Why do you pray to us, o

The rivers: We will listen to your prayers so that you can cross safely.
Historians point out that this hymn was composed in the area where
these rivers flow. They also suggest that the sage lived in a society where
horses and cows were valued animals. That is why the rivers are compared
to horses and cows.

Cattle, horses and chariots
There are many prayers in the Rigveda for cattle,
children (especially sons), and horses. Horses
were yoked to chariots that were used in battles,
which were fought to capture cattle. Battles were
also fought for land, which was important for
pasture, and for growing hardy crops that ripened
quickly, such as barley. Some battles were fought
for water, and to capture people.
Some of the wealth that was obtained was kept
by the leaders, some was given to the priests and
the rest was distributed amongst the people. Some
wealth was used for the performance of yajnas or
sacrifices in which offerings were made into the
fire. These were meant for gods and goddesses.
Offerings could include ghee, grain, and in some
cases, animals.
Most men took part in these wars. There was
no regular army, but there were assemblies where
people met and discussed matters of war and
peace. They also chose leaders, who were often
brave and skilful warriors.

There are several ways of describing people — in
terms of the work they do, the language they
speak, the place they belong to, their family, their
communities and cultural practices. Let us see
some of the words used to describe people found
in the Rigveda.
There are two groups who are described in
terms of their work — the priests, sometimes
called brahmins, who performed various rituals,
and the rajas.
These rajas were not like the ones you will be
learning about later. They did not have capital
cities, palaces or armies, nor did they collect taxes.

Generally, sons did not automatically succeed
fathers as rajas.
Read the previous section once more and see
whether you can find out what the rajas did.
Two words were used to describe the people or
the community as a whole. One was the word
jana, which we still use in Hindi and other
languages. The other was vish. The word vaishya
comes from vish. You will learn more about this
in Chapter 5.
Several vish or jana are mentioned by name.
So we find reference to the Puru jana or vish, the
Bharata jana or vish, the Yadu jana or vish, and
so on.
Do any of these names sound familiar?
Sometimes, the people who composed the
hymns described themselves as Aryas and called
their opponents Dasas or Dasyus. These were
people who did not perform sacrifices, and
probably spoke different languages. Later, the
term dasa (and the feminine dasi) came to mean
slave. Slaves were women and men who were often
captured in war. They were treated as the property
of their owners, who could make them do
whatever work they wanted.
While the Rigveda was being composed in the
north-west of the subcontinent, there were other
developments elsewhere. Let us look at some of
these.

There were several things
that people did to make megaliths. We have made

order: digging pits in the earth, transporting
stones, breaking boulders, placing stones in
position, finding suitable stone, shaping stones,
burying the dead.
All these burials have some common features.
Generally, the dead were buried with distinctive
pots, which are called Black and Red Ware. Also

Archaeologists think that objects found with a
skeleton probably belonged to the dead person.
Sometimes, more objects are found in one grave
than in another. Find Brahmagiri on Map 2
(page 13). Here, one skeleton was buried with 33
gold beads, 2 stone beads, 4 copper bangles, and
one conch shell. Other skeletons have only a few
pots. These finds suggest that there was some
difference in status amongst the people who were
buried. Some were rich, others poor, some chiefs,
others followers.

Sometimes, megaliths contain more than one
skeleton. These indicate that people, perhaps
belonging to the same family, were buried in the
same place though not at the same time. The bodies
of those who died later were brought into the grave
through the portholes. Stone circles or boulders
placed on the surface probably served as signposts
to find the burial site, so that people could return
to the same place whenever they wanted to.

It is easy to make out the skeleton of a child from its small size. However,
there are no major differences in the bones of a girl and a boy.
Can we make out whether a skeleton was that of a man or a
woman?
Sometimes, people decide on the basis of what is found with the
skeleton. For instance, if a skeleton is found with jewellery, it is
sometimes thought to be that of a woman. However, there are
problems with this. Often, men also wore ornaments.
A better way of figuring out the sex of a skeleton is to look at the
bone structure. The hip or the pelvic area of women is generally
larger to enable child bearing.
These distinctions are based on modern skeletal studies.
About 2000 years ago, there was a famous physician named
Charaka who wrote a book on medicine known as the Charaka
Samhita. There he states that the human body has 360 bones. This
is a much larger number than the 200 bones that are recognised in
modern anatomy. Charaka arrived at this figure by counting the
teeth, joints and cartilage.
How do you think he found out about the human body in such
great detail?

Archaeologists have found seeds of wheat, barley,
rice, pulses, millets, peas and sesame. Bones of a
number of animals, many bearing cut marks that
show they may have been used as food, have also
been found. These include cattle, buffalo, goat,
sheep, dog, horse, ass, pig, sambhar, spotted deer,
blackbuck, antelope, hare, and mongoose, besides
birds, crocodile, turtle, crab and fish. There is
evidence that fruits such as ber, amla, jamun, dates
and a variety of berries were collected.

Find China in your atlas. Around 3500 years ago,
we find some of the first evidence of writing in China.
These writings were on animal bones. These are
called oracle bones, because they were used to
predict the future. Kings got scribes to write
questions on the bones — would they win battles?
Would the harvest be good? Would they have sons?
The bones were then put into the fire, and they
cracked because of the heat. Then fortunetellers
studied these cracks, and tried to predict the future.
As you may expect, they sometimes made mistakes.
These kings lived in palaces in cities. They
amassed vast quantities of wealth, including large,
elaborately decorated bronze vessels. However, they
did not know the use of iron.
List one difference between the raja of the Rigveda
and these kings.

Shankaran woke up to see his grandparents all ready to

Choosing leaders or rulers by voting is something
that has become common during the last fifty
years or so. How did men become rulers in the
past? Some of the rajas we read about in Chapter
4 were probably chosen by the jana, the people.
But, around 3000 years ago, we find some
changes taking place in the ways in which rajas
were chosen. Some men now became recognised
as rajas by performing very big sacrifices.
The ashvamedha or horse sacrifice was one
such ritual. A horse was let loose to wander freely
and it was guarded by the raja’s men. If the horse
wandered into the kingdoms of other rajas and
they stopped it, they had to fight. If they allowed
the horse to pass, it meant that they accepted
that the raja who wanted to perform the sacrifice
was stronger than them. These rajas were then
invited to the sacrifice, which was performed by
specially trained priests, who were rewarded with
gifts. The raja who organised the sacrifice was
recognised as being very powerful, and all those
who came brought gifts for him.
The raja was a central figure in these rituals.
He often had a special seat, a throne or a tiger
skin. His charioteer, who was his companion in

the battle field and witnessed his exploits,
chanted tales of his glory. His relatives, especially
his wives and sons, had to perform a variety of
minor rituals. The other rajas were simply
spectators who had to sit and watch the
performance of the sacrifice. Priests performed
the rituals including the sprinkling of sacred water
on the king. The ordinary people, the vish or
vaishya, also brought gifts. However, some people,
such as those who were regarded as shudras by
the priests, were excluded from many rituals.

We have many books that were composed in north India, especially in
the areas drained by the Ganga and the Yamuna, during this period.
These books are often called later Vedic, because they were composed
after the Rigveda about which you learnt in Chapter 4. These include
the Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, as well as other books.
These were composed by priests, and described how rituals were to be
performed. They also contained rules about society.
There were several different groups in society at this time — priests
and warriors, farmers, herders, traders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing
folk, and forest people. Some priests and warriors were rich, as were
some farmers and traders. Others, including many herders, crafts
persons, labourers, fishing folk and hunters and gatherers, were poor.
The priests divided people into four groups, called varnas. According
to them, each varna had a different set of functions.
The first varna was that of the brahmin. Brahmins were expected to
study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts.
In the second place were the rulers, also known as kshatriyas. They
were expected to fight battles and protect people.
Third were the vish or the vaishyas. They were expected to be farmers,
herders, and traders. Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could
perform sacrifices.

The rajas who performed these big sacrifices were
now recognised as being rajas of janapadas rather
than janas. The word janapada literally means
the land where the jana set its foot, and settled
down. Some important janapadas are shown on
Map 4 (page 49).
Archaeologists have excavated a number of
settlements in these janapadas, such as Purana
Qila in Delhi, Hastinapura near Meerut,
and Atranjikhera, near Etah (the last two
are in Uttar Pradesh). They found that
people lived in huts, and kept cattle as well
as other animals. They also grew a variety
of crops — rice, wheat, barley, pulses,
sugarcane, sesame and mustard.
Is there a crop in this list that was not
mentioned in Chapter 3?
Last were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and
could not perform any rituals. Often, women were also grouped with the
shudras. Both women and shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas.
The priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of
birth. For example, if one’s father and mother were brahmins one would
automatically become a brahmin, and so on. Later, they classified some
people as untouchable. These included some crafts persons, hunters
and gatherers, as well as people who helped perform burials and
cremations. The priests said that contact with these groups was polluting.
Many people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the
brahmins. Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others
felt that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna people
belonged to. Besides, some people felt that there should be no differences
amongst people based on occupation. Others felt that everybody should
be able to perform rituals. And others condemned the practice of
untouchability. Also, there were many areas in the subcontinent, such
as the north-east, where social and economic differences were not very
sharp, and where the influence of the priests was limited.
Why did people oppose the system of varnas?

Forts were probably built because people were
afraid of attacks from other kings and needed
protection. It is also likely that some rulers wanted
to show how rich and powerful they were by
building really large, tall and impressive walls
around their cities. Also in this way, the land and
the people living inside the fortified area could be
controlled more easily by the king. Building such
huge walls required a great deal of planning.
Thousands, if not lakhs of bricks or stones had
to be prepared. This in turn meant enormous
labour, provided, possibly, by thousands of men,
women and children. And resources had to be
found for all of this.

The new rajas now began maintaining armies.
Soldiers were paid regular salaries and maintained
by the king throughout the year. Some payments
were probably made using punch marked coins
(see the illustration on page 84). You will read
more about these coins in Chapter 8.

As the rulers of the mahajanapadas were
(a) building huge forts (b) maintaining big armies,
they needed more resources. And they needed
officials to collect these. So, instead of depending
on occasional gifts brought by people, as in the
case of the raja of the janapadas, they started
collecting regular taxes.
•
Taxes on crops were the most important. This was
because most people were farmers. Usually, the tax
was fixed at 1/6th of what was produced. This was
known as bhaga or a share.
•
There were taxes on crafts persons as well. These
could have been in the form of labour. For example,
a weaver or a smith may have had to work for a day
every month for the king.
•
Herders were also expected to pay taxes in the form
of animals and animal produce.
•
There were also taxes on goods that were bought
and sold, through trade.
•
And hunters and gatherers also had to provide
forest produce to the raja.
 What do you think would have been provided
by hunters and gatherers?

Changes in agriculture
There were two major changes in agriculture
around this time. One was the growing use of
iron ploughshares. This meant that heavy, clayey
soil could be turned over better than with a
wooden ploughshare, so that more grain could
be produced. Second, people began transplanting
paddy. This meant that instead of scattering seed
on the ground, from which plants would sprout,
saplings were grown and then planted in the
fields. This led to increased production, as many
more plants survived. However, it was back
breaking work. Generally, slave men and women,
(dasas and dasis) and landless agricultural
labourers (kammakaras) had to do this work.
Can you think why kings would encourage
these changes?

Find Magadha on Map 4 (page 49). Magadha
became the most important mahajanapada in
about two hundred years. Many rivers such as
the Ganga and Son flowed through Magadha. This
was important for (a) transport, (b) water supplies
(c) making the land fertile. Parts of Magadha were
forested. Elephants, which lived in the forest,
could be captured and trained for the army.
Forests also provided wood for building houses,
carts and chariots. Besides, there were iron ore
mines in the region that could be tapped to make
strong tools and weapons.
Magadha had two very powerful rulers,
Bimbisara and Ajatasattu, who used all possible
means to conquer other janapadas. Mahapadma
Nanda was another important ruler. He extended
his control up to the north-west part of the
subcontinent. Rajagriha (present-day Rajgir) in
Bihar was the capital of Magadha for several years.

Later the capital was shifted to Pataliputra
(present-day Patna).
More than 2300 years ago, a ruler named
Alexander, who lived in Macedonia in Europe,
wanted to become a world conqueror. Of course,
he didn’t conquer the world, but did conquer parts
of Egypt and West Asia, and came to the Indian
subcontinent, reaching up to the banks of the
Beas. When he wanted to march further
eastwards, his soldiers refused. They were scared,
as they had heard that the rulers of India had
vast armies of foot soldiers, chariots and
elephants.
In what ways were these armies different from
those described in the Rigveda?

While Magadha became a powerful kingdom, Vajji,
with its capital at Vaishali (Bihar), was under a
different form of government, known as gana or
sangha.
In a gana or a sangha there were not one, but
many rulers. Sometimes, even when thousands
of men ruled together, each one was known as a
raja. These rajas performed rituals together. They
also met in assemblies, and decided what had to
be done and how, through discussion and debate.
For example, if they were attacked by an enemy,
they met to discuss what should be done to meet
the threat. However, women, dasas and
kammakaras could not participate in these
assemblies.
Both the Buddha and Mahavira (about whom
you will read in Chapter 6) belonged to ganas or
sanghas. Some of the most vivid descriptions of
life in the sanghas can be found in Buddhist
books.

There is a substantial difference between Civics
and Social and Political Life, not only in terms of
the topics covered but also in the pedagogic
approaches required in each subject area.
Keeping these in mind, this Introduction
attempts to clarify certain aspects of Social and
Political Life.
What is Social and Political Life?
Social and Political Life (SPL) is a new subject
area in middle school social science that has
replaced the earlier subject of Civics. The
National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005
strongly argues that Civics should be
discontinued and its focus on government
institutions and functioning should be tempered
in the new subject that replaces it. SPL, as its
name suggests, focuses on topics related to
social, political and economic life in
contemporary India.
What pedagogical
approach does SPL use?
SPL’s use of ‘real-life’ situations is a marked
departure from Civics. SPL uses these real
situations to teach concepts because it recognises
that children learn best through concrete
experiences. It uses material that draws upon
the experiential understanding of familial and
social issues that middle school children bring
to the classroom. SPL further develops the
learner’s abilities to critically understand and
analyse these issues in keeping with the tenets
of the Indian Constitution.
This pedagogical approach tends to avoid the
use of definitions to sum up a concept. Instead,
it uses case studies and narratives to explain
concepts. The concepts embedded within the
narratives are made clear through the in-text
and end-text questions. The aim is to have the
learner understand the concept through their
own experiences and write about it in their own
words.
This often means that there is seldom one
‘correct’ answer to the questions posed. However
there is a wrong answer. Teachers should try to
gauge whether an answer to a question
adequately reflects the learner’s understanding
of the concept being discussed.
Given that children learn best through
understanding and applying concepts to
local realities, can a ‘national’ textbook
adequately reflect the many ‘locals’ that
make up the nation?
SPL functions by the pedagogic principle that
children learn best through an experiential
understanding of concepts. This poses a
contradiction when the effort is to write a
‘national’ textbook, because a national text can
neither sufficiently represent all the various
aspects of the various locals, nor fix the
sociocultural background of the child for whom
the book is intended. Therefore, the case studies
and narratives used in SPL are a mix of rural
and urban examples in which the assumed
learner is not easily discernible.
Case studies and narratives used in SPL

In addition to the important job of
transacting the text, what crucial role
does SPL expect teachers to play in the
classroom?
SPL counts on the teacher to play a very
significant role in the classroom for the following
reasons. First, the SPL text specifically names
communities (for example: Dalit, Muslim, poor
etc.) in its discussion of various issues and this
may lead to some discomfort in a classroom that
has a student population from different
sociocultural 
and 
(perhaps) 
economic
backgrounds. We expect the teacher to play a
crucial role in transacting this material with a
sensitivity and firm commitment to respecting the
dignity of all students in the classroom and the
school. Second, given the limited ability of this
‘national’ text to engage the local we also envision
the teacher playing a major role in adding local
examples to the discussion of concepts, provided
these remain true to the logic and understanding
of each concept as intended by the book’s
authors.
How does the SPL help the learner
assimilate the values enshrined in the
Constitution?
At first glance it might appear to some that unlike
Civics, SPL’s focus on ‘real’ examples contradicts
the tenets of the Constitution. Such a focus,
however, is a technique utilised in SPL in
response to a critique of Civics textbooks that
always only discussed the ideal and seldom
deliberated upon the reality that was very
different. Since the learner is already aware of
such realities, to avoid discussing them would
make the learning of social and political concepts
didactic and disconnected. Instead, SPL uses this
embedded awareness to make the learner
understand and accept not only the legitimacy
but also the urgency of the values enshrined in
the Constitution. Additionally, this approach
allows the learner to understand the role of
people’s struggles in the realisation of these
values.
What are the issues included in the
Class VII textbook?
The theme for the Class VII grade book is the
crucial role that equality plays in Indian
democracy. This theme also serves as one of the
Units in addition to which the book has four more
Units. These include Health and State
Government; Gender; Media; and Markets.
Units 2, 3 and 5 consist of two consecutive
chapters, except in the case of the first Unit in
which they make up the first and the concluding
chapters of the text.
What elements does the Class VII book
utilise to explain selected issues?
N Storyboards: One component of the feedback
regarding Class VI book (Social and Political Life-I)
was that teachers needed more assistance in
understanding where fictional narratives began
and ended and in identifying the central concepts
The SPL text specifically names
communities, for example, Dalit, Muslim,
poor, etc. SPL counts on the teacher to
transact the material with a firm
committment to respecting the dignity
of all students.

within these. With this in mind, this year’s book
introduces storyboards to clearly indicate which
segments have been fictionalised, and to draw
the learner into the narrative through the use of
visuals that are often more expressive than lines
of text. Specific concepts raised through the
storyboards are analysed in the accompanying
text.
N Unit Pages: Each Unit begins with a Unit Page
for teachers to help highlight the main points
raised in the chapters.
N Note on Evaluation: As with the Class VI text,
this book does not contain definitions or a
synthesis of concepts. While we recognise that
this makes it difficult for teachers to evaluate
what the child has learnt, our attempt is also to
try and shift some of the understanding amongst
teachers on what children are expected to learn
and how such learning should be evaluated. This
book contains a short note on evaluation
procedures that we hope will assist teachers in
their efforts to move students away from rote
learning.
N Glossary: The inclusion of a Glossary with
each chapter is intended to offer the learner
greater clarity on the language used in the text.
The words of the Glossary are NOT limited to
concepts, and it should not be viewed as
something to be memorised with the expectation
that such rote learning will contribute to
conceptual understanding.
N In-text and End-text Questions: As with the
Class VI text, this year’s book includes in-text
and end-text questions, making use of visual
material and experiential analysis. In-text
questions found within the text can be used to
assess the extent to which content has been
assimilated. End-text questions usually cover
the main concepts raised by the chapter and ask
learners to explain these in their own words.

Teacher’s note on evaluation
Rethinking the ways in which we evaluate learning is a difficult task but one that
this new subject area requires. Over the years our evaluation system has for the
most part rewarded students who learnt by rote. This involuntarily encouraged
many teachers to mark or underline the answers in the text and in this way a
vicious cycle in which each reinforced the other, was produced. It is this system
that needs to be changed to relieve both the teacher and the student. Teachers
will play a significant role in changing evaluation and this note is an effort in
this direction.
Ability to reason
These questions aim to gauge the extent to which the learner has understood the concepts
included in the chapter and is able to articulate its main ideas in their own words as well as
apply these to different contexts. Examples of this include:
What do you understand by the
term, “all persons are equal
before the law”? Why do you
think it is important in a
democracy?
Why should the decisions taken
by the Chief Minister and other
ministers be debated in the
Legislative Assembly?
Can you list two ways in which
you feel that advertising effects
issues of equality in a
democracy?
On questions
Teachers need to begin by insisting that evaluation be based on ‘new’ questions. These will be similar
to the ones used in the text, but not the same. Students will be expected to answer these questions
in their own words. The confidence to do this needs to be built in the students and language corrections
should, therefore, be tactful and gentle.
Teachers will also need to design a variety of questions that cover a range of skills. Questions that
demand recalling information by rote should be minimal. Instead, there needs to be different kinds of
questions based on the main conceptual ideas of each chapter. Some may be designed to draw upon
the learner’s ability to reason; to compare and contrast experiences; and to infer and extrapolate
from situations provided.
The following are some examples taken from this text to explain the above:

Compare and contrast experiences
These questions require the learner to draw upon the main ideas in the text by comparing and
contrasting concrete situations. These questions often involve the child’s own experiences.
Examples of this include:
What is the difference between the
work that MLAs do in the
Assembly and the work done by

the garment exporter and the

Infer and extrapolate from situations
This type of question is important to SPL because of the extensive use of narratives to explain
concepts as well as the constant reference to the learner’s own experiences. It is these questions
that link the narrative to the underlying concept. The learner’s ability to understand the
narrative as well as its explication of the concept can be gauged through these questions.

If you were one of the Ansaris
how would you have responded
to the property dealer’s
suggestion that you change
your name?
On answers
Since the learner is being asked to write in their own words teachers will need to stop expecting
‘exact’ responses. Instead, the learner should be encouraged to state in their own words their
understanding of the material and concepts they’ve read. Their comprehension, ability to soundly
reason and communicate their ideas is what needs to be evaluated.
It would also be fair to expect a range of correct answers when the learner is asked to think
through a particular narrative situation and apply the underlying concept. It is crucial that teachers
discuss a common evaluation scheme that helps them distinguish between the range of correct
answers as well as more crucially identify wrong answers.
An example of what we mean by a range of responses to a question, as well as a wrong answer is
provided below:
Range of right answers
“If I were one of the Ansaris I would have
decided not to change my name because
this would deeply affect my dignity and
self-respect.”
“I would not change my name if I were
one of the Ansaris because this is the
name that my family has had for
generations and it would make me feel
bad to say that I was someone else.”
“I will take up the property dealer’s
suggestion and change my name. I will
do this because I am tired of looking for
a flat. I would not like to do so but I need
a place to stay.”
This is a short, clear answer that indicates good
comprehension and ability to communicate ideas.
Here, the learner does not use the word ‘dignity’, but
has understood the concept and is attempting to
communicate this in her own words.
On the face of it, this might appear to be the wrong
answer since the learner agrees with the property dealer’s
suggestion. If a question has asked for an opinion it could
be either way. As long as the learner puts forward a logical
argument to support their opinion, the answer is right.
This answer shows that they have understood the idea
of the Ansaris’ dignity being affected.
This question is asked as part of the section on
‘Recognising Dignity’ in the text. The learner has not
been able to make the connection between the
discrimination and disrespect faced by the Ansaris, and
their loss of dignity.
Wrong answer
“If I were one of the Ansaris I will agree
to change my name because this will
increase my dignity.”

Other forms of evaluation
We need to demystify the stress on examinations as the best tool for evaluating the
learner. Rather than wait for alternate evaluation structures to trickle down from the
higher grades, we need to use the learner’s years in middle school to experiment with
other ways of evaluation. For this purpose we need to use different methods, some of
which are briefly discussed below –
N Open-book exercises: As the name implies ‘open-book’ is a process in which the
learner is allowed to refer to the textbook while answering a question. Open book
exercises offer children an opportunity to pick out answers without feeling the burden
of “remembering the details”. The learner would be asked to read portions of the text
again with the question in mind. New questions are essential for this exercise.
Questions based on the learner’s ability to infer, extrapolate and apply concepts are
ideal for open-book exercises. Answering the question in the learner’s own words
should be emphasised.
N Oral reasoning and comprehension: Children express so much through speaking
and sharing in a classroom. Yet, most often, our current educational system tends to
regard this as ‘useless talk’. Learning from peers and expressing themselves through
the spoken word is something that needs to be encouraged. Oral evaluation exercises
provide an avenue through which to value this. A number of in-text questions in this
book can be answered orally and the teacher should begin this process in the
classroom.
N Collective project work: Collective project work is another way to evaluate students.
Preparing a wall-paper is one such example used in the text. The expectations from
these projects should be reasonable and limited to what learners can do on their
own. Project work should be done in the classroom and not as homework. Many end-
text questions in this book can be converted into small projects.
These forms of evaluation help emphasise that learning is continuous and happens
in multiple ways. Evaluation should be designed to enable and encourage this learning
and not be reduced to a filtering mechanism.

Equality in Indian Democracy
Teacher’s note
This Unit introduces the learner to the
critical role of equality in democracy, with
specific reference to India. The Constitution
of India guarantees equality to all citizens.
Despite this, the daily lives of people in
India are far from equal. Earlier
discussions on equality in Civics textbooks
most often reiterated certain provisions of
the Constitution without adequately
considering the reality of these in people’s
lives. This Unit adopts a different approach.
It discusses the need for equality through
highlighting the inequalities that continue
to be practised and experienced by various
communities.
The first chapter introduces the learner
to Kanta, Omprakash Valmiki and the
Ansaris, all of whom experience inequality
in different ways. It is through their
experiences that we introduce the concept
of dignity. The government’s role in passing
laws and instituting policies is discussed
to show that commitment to the alleviation
of existing inequalities is a major part of
the work that governments undertake. The
chapter also briefly introduces an issue of
inequality in the United States of America
to highlight that this is a global phenomenon
and a feature of many democratic countries.
The second chapter of this Unit is
Chapter 9 of this book. It ties together the
main ideas on equality raised throughout
the text. A significant portion of the last
chapter is devoted to discussing people’s
contribution to the fight for equality.
This is achieved through focusing on one
social movement as well as highlighting
creative (writings, songs, poems) ways
through which people express their
demands for equality.
Both chapters aim to help the learner
understand that equality and democracy
are dynamic and not static concepts. This
dynamism is reflected in the government’s
passing of new laws and programmes, and
in people’s movements around various
social and economic issues.
Kanta, Omprakash, the Ansaris, and the
Tawa Matsya Sangh all have diverse local
equivalents. Local situations should be
used as a practical reference to make the
discussion on underlying concepts more
relevant and appropriate. A discussion on
equality in the classroom requires empathy
as well as a firm commitment on the
teacher’s part to ensuring that the dignity
of all learners be respected.

The story above begins with Kanta standing in line
to cast her vote. Look again at the various people
who are standing in line with her. Kanta recognises
her employer, Ashok Jain and Chotte Lal, her
neighbour. In a democratic country, like India, all
adults irrespective of what religion they belong to,
how much education they have had, what caste they
are, or whether they are rich or poor are allowed to
vote. This, as you have already read in the Class VI
book, is called universal adult franchise and is an
essential aspect of all democracies. The idea of
universal adult franchise is based on the idea of
equality because it states that every adult in a
country, irrespective of their wealth and the
communities she/he belongs to, has one vote. Kanta
is excited to vote and happy that she is equal to all
of the others because each of them has one vote.
But as her day goes on, Kanta becomes less certain
about what this equality really means.
What is it that makes Kanta unsure? Let’s take a
look at a day in her life. She lives in a slum and has
a drain behind her house. Her daughter is sick but
she cannot take the day off from work because she
needs to borrow money from her employers to take
her child to the doctor. Her job as a domestic help
tires her out, and finally she ends her day by again
standing in a long line. This line, in front of the
government hospital, is unlike the one in the morning
because most of the people standing in it are poor.
Do you think Kanta has
enough reason to doubt
whether she really is equal?

Kanta is one of many people who live in democratic
India and who have the right to vote but whose daily
living and working conditions are far from equal.
Apart from being poor, people in India experience
inequality in different ways. Let us see what this
means by reading the two stories given below. Each
of these is based on real incidents in people’s lives
and reflects the different kinds of inequalities that
exist in India.
One of the more common forms of inequality in
India is the caste system. If you live in rural India
your caste identity is something that you probably
learned or experienced very young. If you live in
urban India some of you might think that people no
longer believe in caste. But just look at these
matrimonials shown from a leading English
newspaper and you will see how important the issue
of caste continues to be in the minds of highly
educated urban Indians.
Now let us read a story about the experiences of a
Dalit child attending school. You have already read
about Dalits in the Class VI book. Dalit is a term
that the so-called lower castes use to address
themselves. Dalit means ‘broken’ and by using this
word, lower castes are pointing to how they were,
and continue to be, seriously discriminated against.
Omprakash Valmiki (1950–2013) is a famous Dalit
writer. In his autobiography, Joothan, he writes, “I
had to sit away from the others in the class, and
that too on the floor. The mat ran out before reaching
the spot I sat on. Sometimes I would have to sit way
behind everybody, right near the door…sometimes
they would beat me without any reason.” When he was
in Class IV, the headmaster asked Omprakash to
sweep the school and the playground. He writes, “The
playground was way larger than my small physique
could handle and in cleaning it, my back began to
ache. My face was covered with dust. Dust had gone

inside my mouth. The other children in my class
were studying and I was sweeping. Headmaster was
sitting in his room and watching me. I was not even
allowed to get a drink of water. I swept the whole
day,…From the doors and windows of the school
rooms, the eyes of the teachers and the boys saw
this spectacle.” Omprakash was made to sweep the
school and the playground for the next couple of
days and this only came to an end when his father,
who happened to be passing by, saw his son
sweeping. He confronted the teachers and then
walking away from the school holding Omprakash’s
hand, he said loudly for all of them to hear, “You are
a teacher…So I am leaving now. But remember this
much Master…(He) will study right here…in this
school. And not just him, but there will be more
coming after him.”
The second story is based on an incident that took
place in one of India’s larger cities and is common
practice in most parts of the country. It is a story
about Mr and Mrs Ansari who were looking to rent
an apartment in the city. They had the money and
so paying the rent was no problem. They went to a
property dealer for help to find a place. The dealer
informed them that he knew about quite a few
apartments that were available for rent. They visited
the first apartment and the Ansaris liked it very much
and decided to take it. However, when the landlady
found out their names, she made an excuse about
how she could not rent the house to someone who
ate meat because the building did not have any
non-vegetarian residents. Both the Ansaris and the
property dealer were surprised to hear this because
they could smell fish being cooked in the neighbour’s
house. The same excuse was repeated in the second
and the third apartments. Finally, the property dealer
told them that they might want to change their names
and call themselves Mr and Mrs Kumar. The Ansaris
were reluctant to do this and decided to look some
more. In the end, it took a whole month of looking at
apartments before they found a landlady who was
willing to give them a place on rent.

Valmiki was being treated unequally

Recognising dignity
You have understood by now that the caste we are
born into, the religion we practice, the class
background we come from, whether we are male or
female – these are often the things that determine
why some people are treated unequally. Omprakash
Valmiki and the Ansaris are being treated unequally
on the basis of differences of caste and religion.
When persons are treated unequally, their dignity
is violated. The dignity of both Omprakash Valmiki
and the Ansaris was violated because of the way in
which they were treated. By picking on him and
making him sweep the school, because of his caste,
Omprakash Valmiki’s schoolmates and teachers hurt
his dignity badly and made him feel as if he was less
than equal to all other students in the school. Being
a child, Omprakash Valmiki could do very little about
the situation that he was in. It was his father who,
on seeing his son sweep, felt angry by this unequal
treatment and confronted the teachers. The Ansaris’
dignity was also hurt when persons refused to lease
their apartments to them. However, when the
property dealer suggested that they change their
name, it was their dignity or self-respect that made
them refuse this suggestion.
Omprakash and the Ansaris do not deserve to be
treated like this. They deserve the same respect and
dignity as anyone else.
Equality in Indian democracy
The Indian Constitution recognises every person as
equal. This means that every individual in the
country, including male and female persons from
all castes, religions, tribes, educational and economic
backgrounds are recognised as equal. This is not to
say that inequality ceases to exist. It doesn’t. But
atleast, in democratic India, the principle of the
equality of all persons is recognised. While earlier

no law existed to protect people from discrimination
and ill-treatment, now there are several that work to
see that people are treated with dignity and as equals.
This recognition of equality includes some of the
following provisions in the Constitution: first that
every person is equal before the law. What this means
is that every person, from the President of the country
to Kanta, a domestic worker, has to obey the same
laws. Second, no person can be discriminated against
on the basis of their religion, race, caste, place of
birth or whether they are female or male. Third, every
person has access to all public places including
playgrounds, hotels, shops and markets. All persons
can use publicly available wells, roads and bathing
ghats. Fourth, untouchability has been abolished.
The two ways in which the government has tried
to implement the equality that is guaranteed in the
Constitution is first through laws and second through
government programmes or schemes to help
disadvantaged communities. There are several laws
in India that protect every person’s right to be treated
equally. In addition to laws, the government has also

set up several schemes to improve the lives of
communities and individuals who have been treated
unequally for several centuries. These schemes are
to ensure greater opportunity for people who have
not had this in the past.
One of the steps taken by the government includes
the midday meal scheme. This refers to the
programme introduced in all government elementary
schools to provide children with cooked lunch. Tamil
Nadu was the first state in India to introduce this
scheme, and in 2001, the Supreme Court asked all
state governments to begin this programme in their
schools within six months. This programme has had
many positive effects. These include the fact that
more poor children have begun enrolling and
regularly attending school. Teachers reported that
earlier children would often go home for lunch and
then not return to school but now with the midday
meal being provided in school, their attendance has
improved. Their mothers, who earlier had to interrupt
their work to feed their children at home during the
day, now no longer need to do so. This programme
has also helped reduce caste prejudices because both
lower and upper caste children in the school eat this
meal together, and in quite a few places, Dalit women
have been employed to cook the meal. The midday
meal programme also helps reduce the hunger of
poor students who often come to school and cannot
concentrate because their stomachs are empty.
While government programmes play an important
role in increasing equality of opportunity, there is
much that still needs to be done. While the midday
meal programme has helped increase the enrolment
and attendance of poor children in school, there
continues to be big differences in our country
between schools that the rich attend and those that
the poor attend. Even today there are several schools
in the country in which Dalit children, like
Omprakash Valmiki, are discriminated against and
treated unequally. These children are forced into
unequal situations in which their dignity is not

respected. This is because people refuse to think of
them as equal even though the law requires it.
One of the main reasons for this is that attitudes
change very slowly. Even though persons are aware
that discrimination is against the law, they continue
to treat people unequally on the basis of their caste,
religion, disability, economic status and because they
are women. It is only when people begin to believe
that no one is inferior, and that every person deserves
to be treated with dignity, that present attitudes can
change. Establishing equality in a democratic society
is a continuous struggle and one in which individuals
as well as various communities in India contribute
to and you will read more about this in this book.
Issues of equality in other democracies
You are probably wondering whether India is the
only democratic country in which there is inequality
and where the struggle for equality continues to
exist. The truth is that in many democratic countries
around the world, the issue of equality continues to
be the key issue around which communities struggle.
So, for example, in the United States of America,
the African–Americans whose ancestors were the
slaves who were brought over from Africa, continue
to describe their lives today as largely unequal. This,
despite the fact that there was a movement in the
late 1950s to push for equal rights for African–
Americans. Prior to this, African–Americans were
treated extremely unequally in the United States
and denied equality through law. For example, when
travelling by bus, they either had to sit at the back
of the bus or get up from their seat whenever a
white person wished to sit.
Rosa Parks (1913–2005) was an African–American
woman. Tired from a long day at work she refused to give
up her seat on a bus to a white man on 1 December 1955.
Her refusal that day started a huge agitation against
the unequal ways in which African–Americans were
“It is disgraceful to live at the cost of one's
self-respect. Self-respect is the most vital
factor in life. Without it, man is a cipher.
To live worthily with self-respect, one has
to overcome difficulties. It is out of hard
and ceaseless struggle alone that one
derives strength, confidence and
recognition.
“Man is mortal. Everyone has to die some
day or the other. But one must resolve to
lay down one's life in enriching the noble
ideals of self-respect and in bettering one's
human life... Nothing is more disgraceful
for a brave man than to live life devoid
of self-respect.”

treated and which came to be known as the Civil
Rights Movement. The Civil Rights Act of 1964
prohibited discrimination on the basis of race,
religion or national origin. It also stated that all
schools would be open to African–American children
and that they would no longer have to attend separate
schools specially set up for them. However, despite
this, a majority of African–Americans continue to be
among the poorest in the country. Most African-
American children can only afford to attend
government schools that have fewer facilities and
poorly qualified teachers as compared to white
students who either go to private schools or live in
areas where the government schools are as highly
rated as private schools.

Social and Political Life
Challenge of democracy
No country can be described as being completely
democratic. There are always communities and
individuals trying to expand the idea of democracy
and push for a greater recognition of equality on
existing as well as new issues. Central to this is the
struggle for the recognition of all persons as equal
and for their dignity to be maintained. In this book
you will read about how this issue of equality affects
various aspects of our daily lives in democratic India.
As you read these chapters, think about whether
the equality of all persons and their being able to
maintain their dignity is upheld.
Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.
(1) The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race,
caste, sex, place of birth or any of them.
(2) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of
them, be subject to any disability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to –
(a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment;
or
(b) the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained
wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated to the use of the general public.

State Government
Teacher’s note
These two chapters (Chapters 2 and 3) on
State Government are an attempt to
discuss the functions and structure of
government through concrete situations.
We have chosen ‘health’ as an example;
there could have been other, equally
important, choices.
Chapter 2 discusses ‘health’ as an
important issue for people. There are both
public and private aspects of health
provisioning. Healthcare in India is not
available to all. While the Constitution
supports a view that the right to health is
an aspect of our fundamental rights, its
provisioning is rather unequal. Through
the accounts provided, learners will begin
to visualise the ideal or desired role of
government, and the meanings behind its
structures. Some ways in which this
situation can be changed are also
discussed.
Chapter 3 focuses on how the
government functions, and discusses ideas
of representation, accountability and
public welfare. Though both the executive
and the legislature are presented, one
should not expect students to retain fine
distinctions. It would be best to patiently
encourage them to ask questions such as,
“Who is the most powerful person?”, “Why
can’t the MLA solve the problem?”, etc.
Such queries will enable them to construct
a sense of the government apparatus.
It is important that learners acquire the
confidence to express their views on public
issues and understand the role of
government through the exercises given in
the chapters. You could choose familiar
issues such as water, transport, school-
fees, books, child-labour, etc., for them to
discuss and arrive at how these problems
need to be tackled. Allow them to express
these ideas through wall charts. Given that
discussions on the government and its
functioning often lead to boredom and
cynicism, we need to be able to make
the classroom session less didactic and
more interactive while teaching these
lessons.

What is health?
We can think of health in many ways. Health means
our ability to remain free of illness and injuries. But
health isn’t only about disease. You may have
associated only some of the situations in the above
collage with health. What we often ignore is the fact
that each of the above situations is related to health.
Apart from disease, we need to think of other factors
that affect our health. For example, if people get clean
drinking water or a pollution free environment they
are likely to be healthy. On the other hand, if people
do not get adequate food to eat or have to live in
cramped conditions, they will be prone to illness.
All of us would like to be active and in good spirits
in whatever we may be doing. It isn’t healthy to be
dull, inactive, anxious or scared for long stretches of
time. We all need to be without mental strain. All of
these various aspects of our lives are a part of health.
Pick two situations from the above
collage that are not related to
illness and write two sentences on
how they are related to health.
Would you associate all or some of
these pictures with ‘health’ ? In
what ways? Discuss in groups.

Let us examine some of the aspects of healthcare
in India. Compare and contrast the situation
expressed in the first and second columns.
 In order to prevent and treat illnesses we need
appropriate healthcare facilities such as health
centres, hospitals, laboratories for testing,
ambulance services, blood banks, etc., that can
provide the required care and services that patients
need. In order to run such facilities we need health
workers, nurses, qualified doctors and other health
professionals who can advice, diagnose and treat
illnesses. We also need the medicines and equipment
that are necessary for treating patients. These
facilities are required to take care of us.

Hakim Seikh was a member of the Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samity (PBKMS), an organisation
of agricultural labourers in West Bengal. One evening in 1992, he accidentally fell off a running
train and suffered head injuries. He was in a very serious condition and needed immediate
treatment.
He was taken to a government hospital in Kolkata but they refused to admit him because they
did not have a spare bed. Another hospital did not have the facility or the specialised doctors
necessary for his treatment. In this way he spent 14 hours in a critical state and was taken to
eight different government hospitals, but none of them admitted him.
Finally, he was admitted in a private hospital, where he received treatment. He spent a lot of
money on his treatment. Angry and upset over the indifferent attitude of all the hospitals that
refused to admit him, Hakim Seikh and PBKMS filed a case in the court.
The story of Hakim Seikh
Read the story given above. Then
imagine that you are a Judge in the
court. What would you say to
Hakim Seikh?
Patients usually have to wait in long queues in
government hospitals, like this one.
India has a large number of doctors, clinics and
hospitals. The country also has considerable
experience and knowledge in running a public
healthcare system. This is a system of hospitals and
health centres run by the government. It has the
ability to look after the health of a large section of
its population scattered over hundreds of thousands
of villages. We will go into more detail on this later.
Moreover, there has been a phenomenal
advancement in medical sciences whereby many new
technologies and treatment procedures are available
in the country.
However, the second column points out how poor
the health situation in our country is. With all the
above positive developments we are not able to provide
proper healthcare facilities to people. This is the
paradox – something that is contrary to what we
would expect. Our country has the money, knowledge
and people with experience but cannot make the
necessary healthcare available to all. In this chapter,
we will look at some of the reasons for this.

Public and private health care services
From the above story, you must have understood
that we can roughly divide up various health care
facilities in two categories –
(a) Public health services and
(b) Private health facilities.
Public health services
The public health service is a chain of health centres
and hospitals run by the government. They are
linked together so that they cover both rural and
urban areas and can also provide treatment to all
kinds of problems – from common illnesses to special
services. At the village level there are health centres
where there is usually a nurse and a village health
worker. They are trained in dealing with common
illnesses and work under the supervision of doctors
at the Primary Health Centre (PHC). Such a centre
covers many villages in a rural area. At the district
level is the District Hospital that also supervises all
the health centres. Large cities have many
government hospitals such as the one where Aman
was taken and also specialised government hospitals
such as the ones in Hakim Seikh’s story.
The health service is called ‘public’ for many
reasons. In order to fulfil its commitment of providing
health care to all citizens, the government has
established these hospitals and health centres. Also,
the resources needed to run these services are
obtained from the money that we, the public, pay to
the government as taxes. Hence, such facilities are
meant for everyone. One of the most important
aspects of the public health system is that it is meant
to provide quality health care services either free or
at a low cost, so that even the poor can seek
treatment. Another important function of public
health is to take action to prevent the spread of
diseases such as TB, malaria, jaundice, cholera,
Why pay taxes to the government?
Government uses tax money for
providing many public services for
the benefit of all citizens. Some
services such as defence, police,
judicial system, highways etc.
benefit all citizens. Otherwise, the
citizens cannot organise these
services for themselves.
Taxes fund developmental
programmes and services such as
education, health care,
employment, social welfare,
vocational training etc. required for
needy citizens. Tax money is
utilised for relief and rehabilitation
in case of natural disasters such as
floods, earthquakes, tsunami etc.
Space, nuclear, and missile
programmes are also funded from
the revenues collected as taxes.
Government provides some
services especially for the poor
who cannot afford to purchase
them from the market. One
example is health care. Can you
give other examples?

diarrhoea, chikungunya, etc. This has to be
organised by the government with the participation
of people otherwise it is not effective. For example,
when taking up a campaign to see that mosquitoes
do not breed in water coolers, rooftops, etc., this
has to be done for all houses in the area.
Recall the case of Hakim Seikh. Would you like to
know what the court said in this case?
According to our Constitution, it is the primary
duty of the government to ensure the welfare of the
people and provide health care facilities to all.
The government must safeguard the Right to Life
of every person. The Court said that the difficulty
that Hakim Seikh had to face could have cost him
his life. If a hospital cannot provide timely medical
treatment to a person, it means that this protection
of life is not being given.
The Court also said that it was the duty of the
government to provide the necessary health services,
including treatment in emergency situations.
Hospitals and medical staff must fulfil their duty of
providing the necessary treatment. Hakim Seikh was
denied treatment at various government hospitals.
Therefore, the Court asked the State Government
to give him the money that he had spent on his
treatment.
Private health facilities
There is a wide range of private health facilities that
exist in our country. A large number of doctors run
their own private clinics. In the rural areas, one
finds Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs). Urban
areas have a large number of doctors, many of them
providing specialised services. There are hospitals
and nursing homes that are privately owned. There
are many laboratories that do tests and offer special
facilities such as X-ray, ultrasound, etc. There are
also shops from where we buy medicines.

Unlike the public health services, in private
facilities, patients have to pay a lot of money for
every service that they use.
Today the presence of private facilities can be seen
all around. In fact now there are large companies
that run hospitals and some are engaged in
manufacturing and selling medicines. Medical shops
are found in every corner of the country.
Healthcare and equality:
Is adequate healthcare available to all?
In India, we face a situation where private services
are increasing but public services are not. What is
then available to people are mainly private services.
These are concentrated in urban areas. The cost of
these services is rather high. Medicines are
expensive. Many people cannot afford them or have
to borrow money when there is an illness in the
family.
Some private services encourage incorrect
practices to earn more. At times inexpensive
alternatives, though available, may not be used. For
example, some medical practitioners are found to
prescribe superfluous medicines, injections or saline
when simple medication may suffice.
 In fact, barely 20 per cent of the population can
afford all the medicines that they require during an

illness. Hence, even for those whom one might not
think as being poor, medical expenses cause
hardship. It was reported in a study that 40 per
cent of people who are admitted to a hospital for
some illness or injury have to borrow money or sell
some of their possessions to pay for the expenses.
For those who are poor, every illness in the family
is a cause of great anxiety and distress. What is worse
is that this situation tends to happen again and
again. Those who are poor are in the first place
undernourished. These families are not eating as
much as they should. They are not provided basic
necessities like drinking water, adequate housing,
clean surroundings, etc., and therefore, are more
likely to fall ill. The expenses on illness make their
situation even worse.
Sometimes it is not only the lack of money that
prevents people from getting proper medical
treatment. Women, for example, are not taken to a
doctor in a prompt manner. Women’s health
concerns are considered to be less important than
the health of men in the family. Many tribal areas
have few health centres and they do not run properly.
Even private health services are not available.
What can be done?
There is little doubt that the health situation of most
people in our country is not good. It is the
responsibility of the government to provide quality
healthcare services to all its citizens, especially the
poor and the disadvantaged. However, health is as
much dependent on basic amenities and social
conditions of the people, as it is on healthcare
services. Hence, it is important to work on both in
order to improve the health situation of our people.
And this can be done. Look at the following example.

The Kerala experience
In 1996, the Kerala government made some major
changes in the state. Forty per cent of the entire state
budget was given to panchayats. They could plan
and provide for their requirements. This made it
possible for a village to make sure that proper
planning was done for water, food, women’s
development and education. This meant that water
supply schemes were checked, the working of schools
and anganwadis was ensured and specific problems
of the village were taken up. Health centres were
also improved. All of this helped to improve the
situation. Despite these efforts, however, some
problems – such as shortage of medicines,
insufficient hospital beds, not enough doctors –
remained, and these needed to be addressed.
For more details, visit http://lsgkerala.gov.in/en
Let us look at an example of another country and
its approach to issues of health.
The Costa Rican approach
Costa Rica is considered to be one of the healthiest
countries in Central America. The main reason for
this can be found in the Costa Rican Constitution.
Several years ago, Costa Rica took a very important
decision and decided not to have an army. This
helped the Costa Rican government to spend the
money that the army would have used, on health,
education and other basic needs of the people. The
Costa Rican government believes that a country has
to be healthy for its development and pays a lot of
attention to the health of its people. The Costa Rican
government provides basic services and amenities
to all Costa Ricans. For example, it provides safe
drinking water, sanitation, nutrition and housing.
Health education is also considered very important
and knowledge about health is an essential part of
education at all levels.

What were the main arguments
put forward by different MLAs
who thought that the government
was not taking the situation in a
serious manner?
If you were the health minister,
how would you respond to the
above discussion?
Do you think the above debate
would have been useful in some
ways? How? Discuss.
In the working of the government,
explain the difference between
being an MLA and an MLA who is
also a minister.
In the earlier section you have read about a debate
in the Legislative Assembly. The members were
debating the action taken or not taken by the
government. This is because the MLAs are together
responsible for the work of the government. In
common usage the word ‘government’ refers to
government departments and various ministers who
head them. The overall head is the chief minister.
More correctly, this is called the executive part of
the government. All the MLAs who gather together
(assemble) in the legislative assembly are called the
Legislature. They are the ones who authorise and
supervise their work. As we saw in the earlier section,
it is from among them that the head of the executive,
or the chief minister is formed.
Working of the government
The Legislative Assembly is not the only place where
opinions are expressed about the work of the
government and action is demanded. You will find
newspapers, TV channels and other organisations
regularly talking about the government. In a
democracy, there are various ways through which
people express their views and also take action. Let
us look at one such way.
Soon after the discussion in the assembly, there
was a press conference organised by the health
minister. Large numbers of people from different
newspapers were present. The minister and some
government officials were also present. The minister
explained the steps the government had taken.
Reporters asked many questions at this meeting.
These discussions were then reported in different
newspapers. The following page has one such report.
During the next week, the chief minister and the
minister for health visited Patalpuram district. They
went to visit the families who had lost their relatives
and also visited people in the hospitals. The
government announced a compensation for these

families. The chief minister also said that he thought
the problem was not only one of sanitation but also
of a lack of clean drinking water. He said that a high-
level enquiry committee will be asked to look into
the needs of the district to provide sanitation facilities
and would request the minister for Public Works to
take care of the needs of proper water supply in the
region.
As you saw above, the people in power like the
chief minister and the minister have to take action.
They do so through various departments like the
Public Works Department, the Agriculture
Department, the Health Department, the Education
Department and so on. They also have to answer
questions that are asked in the Legislative Assembly
and convince people asking the questions that proper
steps are being taken. At the same time, newspapers
and the media widely discuss the issue and the
government has to respond, for example, by holding
the press conferences.
During the last few weeks,
there have been many
deaths in some districts of
our state. There has been a
strong reaction that the
government has not taken
this seriously. The health
minister explained today at
a press conference that his
government has asked all
the collectors and the chief
medical officers to take
urgent measures. The most
important problem is that
of drinking water. The
minister said that they

around for months is

minister said that he would

to voice their opinions and protest

 The government can also decide to make new laws
for the state regarding sanitation and health facilities.
For example, it may make it compulsory for
municipal corporations to ensure that there are
adequate toilets in every urban area. It may also
ensure that a health worker is appointed in every
village. This act of making laws on certain issues is
done in the Legislative Assembly of each state. The
various government departments then implement
these laws. Laws for the entire country are made in
the Parliament. You will read more about the
Parliament next year.
In a democracy, it is the people who elect their
representatives as Members of the Legislative
Assembly (MLAs) and, thus, it is the people who have
the main authority. The ruling party members then
form the government and some members are
appointed ministers. These ministers are in charge
of various departments of the government such as
health in the above example. Whatever work is done
by these departments has to be approved by the
members of the legislative assembly.

The group discusses the issue and decides what it would like

Teacher’s note
Gender is a term that you may often have
heard. It is a term, however, that is not
easily understood. It tends to remain
distant from our lives and restricted to
discussions during training programmes.
In fact, it is something that all of us
experience in our lives on a daily basis. It
determines, for example, who we are and
what we will become, where we can go and
where not, the life choices available to us
and those we eventually make. Our
understanding of gender is often based on
the family and society that we live in. This
leads us to think that the roles we see men
and women around us play are fixed and
natural. In fact, these roles differ across
communities around the world. By gender,
then, we mean the many social values and
stereotypes our cultures attach to the
biological distinction ‘male’ and ‘female’. It
is a term that helps us to understand many
of the inequalities and power relations
between men and women in society.
The following two chapters explore the
concept of gender without actually using
the term. Instead, through different
pedagogic tools like case studies, stories,
classroom activities, data analysis and
photographs, students are encouraged to
question and think about their own lives
and the society around them. Gender is
often mistakenly thought to be something
that concerns women or girls alone. Thus,
care has been taken in these chapters to
draw boys into the discussion as well.
Chapter 4 uses two case studies, situated
in different places and points in time to
show how girls and boys are brought up
or socialised differently. This enables them
to understand that the process of
socialisation is not uniform; instead it is
socially determined and changes
continuously over time. The chapter also
addresses the fact that societies assign
different values to the roles men and
women play and the work they do, which
becomes a basis for inequality and
discrimination. Through a storyboard,
students discuss the issue of housework.
Done primarily by women, housework is
often not considered ‘work’ and, therefore
made invisible and devalued.
 Chapter 5 further develops ideas around
gender inequalities in the world of work and
describes women’s struggles for equality.
Through a classroom activity, students
begin questioning existing stereotypes
regarding work and career choices. The
chapter also points out that opportunities
like education are not equally available to
boys and girls. By reading about the lives
of two Indian women, from the ninteenth
and twentieth centuries, students see how
women struggled to change their lives by
learning to read and write. Change on a
large scale usually takes place through
collective struggles. The chapter concludes
with a photo-essay that gives examples of
different strategies the women’s movement
has used to fight for change.

We often grow up thinking that
these things are exactly the same
everywhere. But do all societies
look at boys and girls in the same
way? We will try and answer this
question in this chapter. We will
also look at how the different roles
assigned to boys and girls prepare
them for their future roles as men
and women. We will learn that
most societies value men and
women differently. The roles
women play and the work they do
are usually valued less than the
roles men play and the work they
do. This chapter will also examine
how inequalities between men and
women emerge in the area of work.

A Class VII Samoan child

Why do girls like to go to school
together in groups?
Growing up in Samoa in the 1920s
The Samoan Islands are part of a large group of small
islands in the southern part of the Pacific Ocean. In
the 1920s, according to research reports on Samoan
society, children did not go to school. They learnt
many things, such as how to take care of children or
do household work from older children and from
adults. Fishing was a very important activity on the
islands. Young people, therefore, learnt to undertake
long fishing expeditions. But they learnt these things
at different points in their childhood.
As soon as babies could walk, their mothers or
other adults no longer looked after them. Older
children, often as young as five years old, took over
this responsibility. Both boys and girls looked after
their younger siblings. But, by the time a boy was
about nine years old, he joined the older boys in
learning outdoor jobs like fishing and planting
coconuts. Girls had to continue looking after small
children or do errands for adults till they were
teenagers. But, once they became teenagers they had
much more freedom. After the age of fourteen or so,
girls also went on fishing trips, worked in the
plantations, learnt how to weave baskets. Cooking
was done in special cooking-houses, where boys were
supposed to do most of the work while girls helped
with the preparations.

The following is adapted from an account of
experiences of being in a small town in Madhya

differently from the boys’ school. They had a central
courtyard where they played in total seclusion and

safety from the outside world. The boys’ school had
no such courtyard and our playground was just a
big space attached to the school. Every evening, once
school was over, the boys watched as hundreds of
school girls crowded the narrow streets. As these
girls walked on the streets, they looked so purposeful.
This was unlike the boys who used the streets as a
place to stand around idling, to play, to try out tricks
with their bicycles. For the girls, the street was simply
a place to get straight home. The girls always went
in groups, perhaps because they also carried fears
of being teased or attacked.
After reading the two examples above, we realise
that there are many different ways of growing up.
Often we think that there is only one way in which
children grow up. This is because we are most
familiar with our own experiences. If we talk to elders
in our family, we will see that their childhoods were
probably very different from ours.
We also realise that societies make clear
distinctions between boys and girls. This begins from
a very young age. We are for example, given different
toys to play with. Boys are usually given cars to play
with and girls dolls. Both toys can be a lot of fun to
play with. Why are girls then given dolls and boys
cars? Toys become a way of telling children that they
will have different futures when they become men
and women. If we think about it, this difference is
created in the smallest and most everyday things.
How girls must dress, what games boys should play,
how girls need to talk softly or boys need to be tough.
All these are ways of telling children that they have
specific roles to play when they grow up to be men
and women. Later in life this affects the subjects we
can study or the careers we can choose.
In most societies, including our own, the roles men
and women play or the work they do, are not valued
equally. Men and women do not have the same
status. Let us look at how this difference exists in
the work done by men and women.

Valuing housework
Harmeet’s family did not think that the work Jaspreet
did within the house was real work. This feeling is
not unique to their families. Across the world, the
main responsibility for housework and care-giving
tasks, like looking after the family, especially
children, the elderly and sick members, lies with
women. Yet, as we have seen, the work that women
do within the home is not recognised as work. It is
also assumed that this is something that comes
naturally to women. It, therefore, does not have to
be paid for. And society devalues this work.

Lives of domestic workers
In the story above, Harmeet’s mother was not the
only one who did the housework. A lot of the work
was done by Mangala, their domestic helper.
Many homes, particularly in towns and cities,
employ domestic workers. They do a lot of work –
sweeping and cleaning, washing clothes and
dishes, cooking, looking after young children or
the elderly. Most domestic workers are women.
Sometimes, even young boys or girls are employed
to do this work. Wages are low, as domestic work
does not have much value. A domestic worker’s
day can begin as early as five in the morning and
end as late as twelve at night! Despite the hard
work they do, their employers often do not show
them much respect. This is what Melani, a
domestic worker had to say about her experience
of working in Delhi – “My first job was with a rich
family that lived in a three-storeyed house. The
memsahib was very strange as she would shout
to get any work done. My work was in the kitchen.
There were two other girls who did the cleaning.
Our day would begin at 5 o’clock. For breakfast
we would get a cup of tea and two dry rotis. We
could never get a third roti. In the evening, when
I cooked the food, the two other girls would beg
me to give them an extra roti. I would secretly
give it to them and make an extra one for myself.
We were so hungry after working through the day!
We could not wear chappals in the house. In the
winter, our feet would swell up with the cold. I
used to feel scared of the memsahib but also felt
angry and humiliated. Did we not work all day?
Did we not deserve to be treated with some
respect?”
In fact, what we commonly term as housework
actually involves many different tasks. A number
of these tasks require heavy physical work. In
both rural and urban areas women and girls have
to fetch water. In rural areas women and girls
carry heavy headloads of firewood. Tasks like

Many women like Shonali’s mother in
the story and the women in Tamil Nadu
and Haryana who were surveyed work
both inside and outside the home. This is
often referred to as the double burden of
women’s work.
washing clothes, cleaning, sweeping and picking up
loads require bending, lifting and carrying. Many
chores, like cooking, involve standing for long hours
in front of hot stoves. The work women do is
strenuous and physically demanding — words that
we normally associate with men.
Another aspect of housework and care-giving that
we do not recognise is that it is very time consuming.
In fact, if we add up the housework and the work,
women do outside the home, we find that women
spend much more time working than men and have
much less time for leisure.
Below is some data from a special study done
by the Central Statistical Organization of India
(1998-1999). See if you can fill in the blanks.
Women’s work and equality
As we have seen the low value attached to women’s
household and care-giving work is not an individual
or family matter. It is part of a larger system of
inequality between men and women. It, therefore,
has to be dealt with through actions not just at the
level of the individual or the family but also by the
government. As we now know, equality is an
important principle of our Constitution. The
Constitution says that being male or female should
not become a reason for discrimination. In reality,
inequality between the sexes exists. The government
is, therefore, committed to understanding the reasons
for this and taking positive steps to remedy the
situation. For example, it recognises that burden of
child-care and housework falls on women and girls.

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children’s life at school
must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy
of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school,
home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an
attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the
maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will
take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in
the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take
to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and
questions. We must recognise that given space, time and freedom, children generate new
knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the
prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources
and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive
and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility
in the daily timetable is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the
required number of teaching days is actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching
and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life
at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have
tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge
at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for
teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space
to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities
requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the
hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish
to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in Social Sciences, Professor Hari Vasudevan,
the Chief Advisor, Sarada Balagopalan and the Advisor, Dipta Bhog for guiding the work of
this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful
to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations
which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We
are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by
the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resources
Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P.
Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an organisation committed to systemic
reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments
and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

112,Social Science - Civics,Class 8,General Social Studies,General Social Studies - Class 8,3,"This is the third and final textbook on Social and Political Life. In the higher classes, the students will
continue to learn some of what we have discussed within the subject areas of political science and
economics. In our ‘Introductory Note’ over the past two years, we had emphasised what this new
subject area was about. This year’s note is more personal as we write about what motivated us to
create these textbooks in this manner and the central role that teachers play in transacting them.
Often teachers feel overwhelmed by frequent revisions in the curriculum. These are revisions
that they seldom have any role in drafting but have to implement in the classroom space. Often
teachers do not understand the basis for the changes. This results in some amount of frustration
and cynicism about the effectiveness of any change. This skepticism can in some cases result in
teachers not taking the new subject area very seriously. It may also lead to teachers’ unwillingness to
adopt new teaching practices that the new subject area relies upon. We hope that through sharing
with you what has compelled us to develop these textbooks differently, over the past three years,
you will recognise the significant role that teachers have in realising the pedagogic goals of Social
and Political Life.
In hindsight, it appears we took up quite an exciting, though daunting, task three years ago
when we decided that we would help flesh out a new subject area in middle-school social science.
The task was exciting because quite a few of us had been involved with the teaching of Civics in
school and knew how tedious the subject was to students. Or, we had done an analysis of civics
textbooks and were dismayed by their limited understanding of Indian democracy. We were
particularly troubled by two factors: one, the textbook’s lack of any concrete examples to highlight
the functioning of democracy in people’s lives in India and two, its tendency to portray institutions
and processes as if they functioned exactly in the ways in which the Constitution intended.
In addition, some of us had been part of a research project that showed that students were
often confused between processes, institutions and individuals in government. For example, they
were often not able to distinguish between the legislature and the executive. As teachers, you probably

113,Social Science - Civics,Class 8,General Social Studies,General Social Studies - Class 8,3,"often reflect upon such limitations of civics textbooks. We were also motivated by the fact that
contemporary social and political issues did not have any space in the middle-school curriculum.
Though civics had tried to raise these through a focus on the government, a new subject area was
an opportunity to enlarge this focus and make it more exciting to teach without losing sight of the
government’s role.
We were confronted by three different types of questions. The first of these was: how can we
get students to understand contemporary social and political concerns? The first question brought
forth the following tentative ideas: one, we would need content that was grounded in the lives of
students; two, students needed to understand that ‘democracy’ is not limited to the functioning of
government institutions but depends primarily on the role played by ordinary persons; and three,
change in content would simultaneously require a different pedagogic style.
The second question that struck us concerned the choice of themes within the subject area. Here
we have explored many new themes, trying to balance what is appropriate for the middle school with
a certain depth of analysis. It is unfortunate that social science has increasingly come to be viewed by
students a box full of general knowledge facts to be learnt by rote. This existing understanding is
completely opposed to what social science is meant to do, i.e. to provide a lens through which to
analyse the world around us. This ability to analyse social issues is increasingly being viewed as a
necessary and desirable skill to possess even amongst those who teach ‘Science’ in Universities. As
social science teachers, we should be proud of our subject area and the opportunity it provides to
build in the student a critical and informed way of looking at their contemporary world.
The third question related to the role that we expected teachers to play in this new subject area.
This was more within the realm of pedagogy and we had the following thoughts on this: one, that
as often as possible we would not provide definitions for concepts that we discussed, two, that we
would use stories and other forms of creative expression including storyboards to help the students
empathise with the issues being raised, and three, that the in-text and end-text questions we asked
would make students engage analytically with the material presented. The visuals that the book
used, whether they be storyboards, photos or photo essays, were integral to the content and could
be used for further analysis of issues. These should not be seen as decorative.
Quite naturally for all of these ideas to materialise within the space of the classroom, we had to
rely on more than the textbook. A national textbook, we recognised, would always fall short of
providing particular content that was grounded in the vast diversity of students’ lives in this country.
As far as possible, we have tried to spread the case studies across regions and social groups.
Secondly, since contemporary concerns would necessarily highlight the inequalities that were woven
into our social fabric, there was a need for mediation of information and opinion in the classroom
space. And, this role is best played by teachers. So your role is not just to transact the content of the
textbook but you have been expected from the start to bring in different, more local, examples
and help students develop their own analysis of important issues. These textbooks also mark a
departure from earlier ones precisely because they name and identify specific forms of inequality.
These caste, religious and gender distinctions are also realities that are present in the classroom and
therefore, our expectation is also that you will handle these situations with the necessary sensitivity.
Paulo Freire, the Brazilian educator (who characterised rote learning as akin to depositing
money in a bank) wrote that teachers should attempt to, “live part of their dreams within their
educational space (i.e. in schools)”. And, we hoped that the social and political life classroom
would serve quite easily as this space for teachers because the topics discussed in the textbooks
2019-20",What were the three types of questions that struck us?,"emphasised what this new
subject area was about",in-text and end-text,"systemic
reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products",Hari Vasudevan,B,in-text and end-text,Hard
114,Social Science - Civics,Class 8,General Social Studies,General Social Studies - Class 8,3,"were deeply connected to people’s struggles for justice, equality and dignity. We hoped that the
teachers’ strong identification with the topics discussed would allow them to guide students to
critically pose questions on contemporary issues.
We also realised that this critical lens we wanted students to develop would need to be linked
to a larger vision. This was needed for them to make a more informed analysis as well as not
develop a cynicism when confronted with stark realities of social and political life in India. We
wanted them to be critical and positive at the same time. And, although this might sound
contradictory to you, we were quite sure that we did not want one without the other. For students
to be confronted by only unequal realities without having any idea about how matters could be
better, would have been frustrating. And on the flip side, to have them to learn about India only as
an ideal democracy, in order that they remain positive, would have been misleading, given that their
everyday realities are constantly telling them a different story.
Luckily for us, the country has a visionary document as well as a history of people’s struggles.
It is these two tools that we deliberately decided to draw upon to help make a critical analysis
simultaneously a hopeful and positive experience for students. The Indian Constitution is a visionary
document and has been used as such by several individuals and social movements to address issues
of injustice and oppression. We have used the Constitution to serve as the moral compass for this
new subject area. In addition, the book also utilises social movements to meaningfully show students
that the existence of the Constitution does not in and of itself guarantee equality and dignity but
that people continuously struggle to realise these in their lives.
As we developed this last book, we were also aware that in the future changes will be made to
the social and political life curriculum as well as these textbooks. We hope that sharing the above
reasons – why we developed these texts as well as what we hope the teacher and student will bring
to the analyses presented – will allow you to deepen your commitment to this subject area. We
hope that it will allow you to recognise that as the only subject area that deals with contemporary
social and political issues in middle-school classes, Social and Political Life series provides you with a
great opportunity to explore the ways in which your students’ lives are tied to broader societal
issues. We would like for you to use this opportunity to begin to change the ways in which students
are forced to learn information by rote in the classroom space. Since the information provided in
these textbooks provides enough room to introduce connected local concerns and to develop an
analysis based on this, you need to exercise an active role in making the classroom space exciting as
well as safe for students of all backgrounds to air their opinions without feeling left out, ridiculed
or silenced.
The task of establishing a new subject area through a textbook is not easy. Social and Political Life
because of its focus on the contemporary will also be controversial at times. We can’t run away
from this. While you would allow a variety of opinions to be expressed, this would be based on a
large amount of trust in your sense of justice and dignity for all. If you believe that schools can
help build in the child a sense of a just society, then Social and Political Life provides you a great
opportunity to do this. It is our keen hope that you take up our offer.

The Class VIII book has a focus on rule of law and social justice. The units are devoted to the following topics:
the Indian Constitution, the Parliament, the Judiciary, Social Marginalisation and the Economic Presence of
Government. Each unit consists of two chapters. In this book, students learn what law is and what is meant by
rule of law. They also learn that often laws are not enough and people continue to struggle to have their fundamental
rights realised long after laws have been passed to guarantee these. The book ends with a note on the ‘Constitution
as a Living Ideal’. This note serves the function of tying together the main ideas raised in the book.
What elements does the Class VIII book utilise to explain selected issues?
Storyboards: We have received feedback that the storyboards that we introduced last year worked well in the
classroom with both students and teachers. This year, we have continued to use this visual medium to discuss
narratives that are fictional but based on real events. We hope students will be drawn into the narrative and this
will help them better understand the concepts and processes that the storyboard depicts.

Teacher’s Note
The Indian Constitution has been regularly referred to in the previous two Social and Political Life
textbooks. Unlike the previous two books, where little space was devoted to discussing the
Constitution itself, this year the chapters in Unit 1 take the Constitution as its main focus.
Chapter 1 begins with a discussion of the principles that underlie a liberal constitution. Three short
storyboards have been used to familiarise the student with the ideas that are being discussed.
The storyboards use incidents located within a classroom-setting to illustrate three complex
constitutive principles. The storyboards should be used to aid the student’s understanding of these
constitutive principles.
The discussion on the Indian Constitution is situated within a historical context. This has been done
with the express intent that students become aware of the major influence that our anti-colonial
struggle had on Indian democracy. In discussing the Constitution, we have had to use several new, and
often difficult terms, to explain certain key features. While teaching these, please keep in mind that
the student will continue to study these key features in greater depth in higher classes. Therefore, the
attempt here is to familiarise the student with a very basic understanding of the significance of these
features within the working of democracy in India.
Chapter 2 discusses secularism. The most prevalent definition of secularism is that it refers to the
separation between Religion and the State. The chapter uses this definition as the foundation and
then proceeds to elucidate two complicated ideas: the first points to why this separation is important
and the second to what is particular to Indian secularism.
There are two main reasons why the separation between Religion and State is important. The first
is to prevent the domination of one religion over another, i.e. inter-religious domination. The second
is to oppose the various types of domination that can happen within a religion, i.e. intra-religious
domination. For example, the chapter discusses untouchability in Hindu religious practice which
allowed ‘upper castes’ to dominate members of some ‘lower castes’. Secularism’s opposition to
institutionalised religion means that it promotes freedom and equality between and within religions.
The second major conceptual idea that the chapter deals with is the unique nature of Indian
secularism. Indian secularism does protect the religious freedom of individuals by maintaining a
separation from religion. But it also provides room for the reform of religions, for example, the
abolishing of untouchability, child marriage, etc. Therefore, in its attempt to achieve religious equality
(both between as well as within religions) the Indian secular State both maintains a separation as
well as intervenes in religion. This intervention can either be in terms of a ban (like that on
untouchability) or in terms of providing assistance to religious minorities. The chapter explains this
and refers to it as ‘principled distance’. This means that any interference in religion by the State has
to be based on the ideals laid out in the Constitution.
Several of the above points are quite complex. It is crucial that you understand these points clearly
before teaching this chapter. It is very likely that students will come up with several suggestions for
why the government should intervene or not intervene in religious affairs. While discussion is to be
encouraged, it is important to mediate this and ensure that it does not reinforce stereotypes of
religious minorities.

In this chapter, we are going to begin with football, a
game many of you have probably heard of, or even
played. As the name suggests, this is a game that involves
the players’ feet. According to the rules of football, if
the ball touches the arm of any player (except the
goalkeeper), then this is considered a foul. So if players
start holding the football in their hands and passing it
around, then they are not playing football any more.
Similarly other games, such as hockey or cricket, also
have rules according to which they are played. Each of
these rules helps define the game, and helps us
distinguish one game from another. As these are
fundamental to the game, we can also call them the
constitutive rules of the game. Like these games, a
society also has constitutive rules that make it what it
is and differentiate it from other kinds of societies. In
large societies in which different communities of people
live together, these rules are formulated through
consensus, and in modern countries this consensus is
usually available in written form. A written document
in which we find such rules is called a Constitution.
We have looked at the Indian Constitution in Classes VI
and VII in our Social and Political Life textbooks. Have
you ever wondered why we need a Constitution or been
curious about how the Constitution got written, or who
wrote it? In this chapter, we will discuss both these
issues and also look at the key features of the Indian
Constitution. Each of these features is crucial to the
working of democracy in India and some of these will
be the focus of different chapters in this book.

The Indian Constitution
Today most countries in the world have a Constitution.
While all democratic countries are likely to have a
Constitution, it is not necessary that all countries that have
a Constitution are democratic. The Constitution serves
several purposes. First, it lays out certain ideals that form
the basis of the kind of country that we as citizens aspire to
live in. Or, put another way, a Constitution tells us what
the fundamental nature of our society is. A country is
usually made up of different communities of people who
share certain beliefs but may not necessarily agree on all
issues. A Constitution helps serve as a set of rules and
principles that all persons in a country can agree upon as
the basis of the way in which they want the country to be
governed. This includes not only the type of government
but also an agreement on certain ideals that they all believe
the country should uphold.
Why Does a Country Need a Constitution?
In 1934, the Indian National Congress made
the demand for a Constituent Assembly.
During the Second World War, this assertion
for an independent Constituent Assembly
formed only of Indians gained momentum
and this was convened in December 1946.
The photo on page 2 shows some members
of the Constituent Assembly.
Between December 1946 and November
1949, the Constituent Assembly drafted a
constitution for independent India. Free to
shape their destiny at last, after 150 years
of British rule, the members of the
Constituent Assembly approached this task
with the great idealism that the freedom
struggle had helped produce. You will read
more about the work of the Constituent
Assembly later in the chapter.
The photo alongside shows Prime Minister
Jawaharlal Nehru addressing the
Constituent Assembly.

In democratic societies, the Constitution often lays down
rules that guard against this misuse of authority by our political
leaders. In the case of the Indian Constitution, about which
you will read more later in this chapter, many of these laws are
contained in the section on Fundamental Rights. Do you recall
the chapter on the Dalit writer, Omprakash Valmiki’s
experiences in school from your Class VII book? In that chapter,
we talked about the discrimination Omprakash faced because
he was a Dalit. You read about how the Indian Constitution
guarantees the right to equality to all persons and says that no
citizen can be discriminated against on grounds of religion,
race, caste, gender, and place of birth. The Right to Equality is
one of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Indian
Constitution.
government or polity, the Constitution plays a crucial role in
laying out certain important guidelines that govern decision-
making within these societies.
In a democracy, we choose our leaders so that they can exercise
power responsibly on our behalf. However, there is always the
possibility that these leaders might misuse their authority and
the Constitution usually provides safeguards against this. This
misuse of authority can result in gross injustice as demonstrated
in the classroom situation below:
1. In what way is the class
monitor misusing his power?
2. In which of the following
situations is a minister
misusing his power:
a) refuses to sanction a project
of his ministry for sound
technical reasons;
b) threatens to send his
security staff to rough up his
neighbour;
c) calls up the police station
asking them not to register a
complaint that is likely to be
filed against his relative.
Suresh is the class monitor. He is a
bully. His classmates are not too fond
of him. Mrs Rao, the class teacher, has
to leave the classroom on some urgent
work. She asks Suresh to mind the class.
Suresh starts picking on Anil.
When Mrs Rao returns to the class …
Ma’am, while you were away,
Anil kept talking loudly and
disturbing the class. He would
not listen to me.
Anil, you will have to
stay back after school
today and write ‘I will
not disobey the class
monitor’ a 100 times.
But … Ma’am … I
did not do anything!
Anil, today I am going to
report you to Mrs Rao.
But what have I done?

Such unhealthy situations can occur in democratic
societies too, where a majority can continuously
enforce decisions that exclude minorities and go
against their interests. As the above storyboard
illustrates, every society is prone to this tyranny of
the majority. The Constitution usually contains rules
that ensure that minorities are not excluded from
anything that is routinely available to the majority.
Another reason why we have a Constitution is
precisely to prevent this tyranny or domination by
the majority of a minority. This can refer to one
community dominating another, i.e. inter-community
domination, or members of one community
dominating others within the same community, i.e.
intra-community domination.
Another important function that a Constitution plays in a
democracy is to ensure that a dominant group does not use
its power against other, less powerful people or groups. The
storyboard below demonstrates one such situation in the
classroom.
Who is in a minority in the
above storyboard? In what way
is this minority being
dominated by the decision
taken by the majority?

problem with a show of hands.

122,Social Science - Civics,Class 8,General Social Studies,General Social Studies - Class 8,3,"9
Similarly, the Constitution helps to protect us against
certain decisions that we might take that could have an
adverse effect on the larger principles that the country
believes in. For example, it is possible that many people
who live in a democracy might come to strongly feel that
party politics has become so acrimonious that we need a
strong dictator to set this right. Swept by this emotion,
they may not realise that in the long run, dictatorial rule
goes against all their interests. A good Constitution does
not allow these whims to change its basic structure. It does
not allow for the easy overthrow of provisions that
guarantee rights of citizens and protect their freedom.
From the above discussion, you will understand that the
Constitution plays a very important role in democratic
societies.
The third significant reason why we need a Constitution
is to save us from ourselves. This may sound strange but
what is meant by this is that we might at times feel strongly
about an issue that might go against our larger interests
and the Constitution helps us guard against this. Look at
the storyboard below to understand this better:

Now let us try and understand the ways in which the above
points get translated into certain ideals and rules by
studying some key features of the Indian Constitution.
The Indian Constitution: Key Features
By the beginning of the twentieth century, the Indian
national movement had been active in the struggle for
independence from British rule for several decades. During
the freedom struggle the nationalists had devoted a great
deal of time to imagining and planning what a free India
would be like. Under the British, they had been forced to
obey rules that they had had very little role in making.
The long experience of authoritarian rule under the colonial
state convinced Indians that free India should be a
democracy in which everyone should be treated equally
and be allowed to participate in government. What
remained to be done then was to work out the ways in
which a democratic government would be set up in India
and the rules that would determine its functioning. This
was done not by one person but by a group of around 300
people who became members of the Constituent Assembly
in 1946 and who met periodically for the next three years
to write India’s Constitution.
There was an extraordinary sense of unity
amongst the members of the Constituent
Assembly. Each of the provisions of the future
constitution was discussed in great detail and
there was a sincere effort to compromise and
reach an agreement through consensus. The
above photo shows Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a
prominent member of the Constituent Assembly.
Let us recap the reasons why the Constitution plays an important role in democratic societies by
recalling the constitutive rules that you have read about through these examples:

These members of the Constituent Assembly had a huge
task before them. The country was made up of several
different communities who spoke different languages,
belonged to different religions, and had distinct cultures.
Also, when the Constitution was being written, India was
going through considerable turmoil. The partition of the
country into India and Pakistan was imminent, some of
the Princely States remained undecided about their future,
and the socio-economic condition of the vast mass of people
appeared dismal. All of these issues played on the minds of
the members of the Constituent Assembly as they drafted
the Constitution. They rose to the occasion and gave this
country a visionary document that reflects a respect for
maintaining diversity while preserving national unity. The
final document also reflects their concern for eradicating
poverty through socio-economic reforms as well as
emphasising the crucial role the people can play in choosing
their representatives.
Listed below are the key features of the Indian Constitution.
While reading these, keep in mind the above-mentioned
concerns of diversity, unity, socio-economic reform and
representation that the authors of this document were
grappling with. Try and understand the ways in which they
tried to balance these concerns with their commitment to
transforming independent India into a strong, democratic
society.
1. Federalism: This refers to the existence of more than
one level of government in the country. In India, we have
governments at the state level and at the centre. Panchayati
Raj is the third tier of government and you have read about
this in your Class VI book. We looked at the functioning
of the state government in your Class VII book and this
year we will read more about the central government.
The vast number of communities in India meant that a system
of government needed to be devised that did not involve only
persons sitting in the capital city of New Delhi and making
Baba Saheb Dr Ambedkar is known as the
Father of the Indian Constitution.
Dr Ambedkar believed that his participation
in the Constituent Assembly helped the
Scheduled Castes get some safeguards in
the draft constitution. But he also stated
that although the laws might exist,
Scheduled Castes still had reason to fear
because the administration of these laws
were in the hands of ‘caste Hindu officers’.
He, therefore, urged Scheduled Castes to
join the government as well as the civil
services.

decisions for everyone. Instead, it was important to have
another level of government in the states so that decisions
could be made for that particular area. While each state in
India enjoys autonomy in exercising powers on certain issues,
subjects of national concern require that all of these states
follow the laws of the central government. The Constitution
contains lists that detail the issues that each tier of
government can make laws on. In addition, the Constitution
also specifies where each tier of government can get the
money from for the work that it does. Under federalism,
the states are not merely agents of the federal government
but draw their authority from the Constitution as well. All
persons in India are governed by laws and policies made by
each of these levels of government.
2. Parliamentary Form of Government: The different tiers
of government that you just read about consist of
representatives who are elected by the people. Your Class
VII book began with the story of Kanta who
was standing in line to vote during an election. The
When the Constituent Assembly adopted the
principle of universal adult franchise, Shri A.K.
Ayyar, a member, remarked that this was done,
“with an abundant faith in the common man
and the ultimate success of democratic rule,
and in the full belief that the introduction of
democratic government on the basis of adult
suffrage will bring enlightenment and promote
the well-being, the standard of life, the
comfort, and the decent living of the common
man”.

Nation. Clarendon Press, Oxford.

The word ‘State’ is often used in this chapter. This does
NOT refer to state governments. Rather when we use
State, we are trying to distinguish it from ‘government’.
‘Government’ is responsible for administering and
enforcing laws. The government can change with
elections. The State on the other hand refers to a
political institution that represents a sovereign people
who occupy a definite territory. We can, thus, speak of
the Indian State, the Nepali State etc. The Indian State
has a democratic form of government. The government (or
the executive) is one part of the State. The State refers to
more than just the government and cannot be used
interchangeably with it.
Constitution of India guarantees universal adult suffrage
for all citizens. When they were making the Constitution,
the members of the Constituent Assembly felt that the
freedom struggle had prepared the masses for universal adult
suffrage and that this would help encourage a democratic
mindset and break the clutches of traditional caste, class
and gender hierarchies. This means that the people of India
have a direct role in electing their representatives. Also,
every citizen of the country, irrespective of his/her social
background, can also contest in elections. These
representatives are accountable to the people. You will read
more about why representation is crucial to democratic
functioning in Unit 2 of this book.
3. Separation of Powers: According to the Constitution, there
are three organs of government. These are the legislature, the
executive and the judiciary. The legislature refers to our elected
representatives. The executive is a smaller group of people who
are responsible for implementing laws and running the
government. The judiciary, of which you will read more in Unit
3 of this book, refers to the system of courts in this country. In
order to prevent the misuse of power by any one branch of
government, the Constitution says that each of these organs
should exercise different powers. Through this, each organ acts
as a check on the other organs of government and this ensures
the balance of power between all three.
Discuss the difference between
State and Government with
your teacher.
Members of the Constituent Assembly
feared that the executive might become too
strong and ignore its responsibility to the
legislature. The Assembly, therefore,
included a number of provisions in the
Constitution to limit and control the action
taken by the executive branch of
government as a whole.

4. Fundamental Rights: The section on Fundamental
Rights has often been referred to as the ‘conscience’ of the
Indian Constitution. Colonial rule had created
a certain suspicion of the State in the minds of
the nationalists and they wanted to ensure that a set
of written rights would guard against the misuse of State
power in independent India. Fundamental Rights,
therefore, protect citizens against the arbitrary
and absolute exercise of power by the State. The
Constitution, thus, guarantees the rights of individuals
against the State as well as against other individuals.
Moreover, the various minority communities also expressed
the need for the Constitution to include rights that would
protect their groups. The Constitution, therefore, also
guarantees the rights of minorities against the majority. As
Dr Ambedkar has said about these Fundamental Rights, their
object is two-fold. The first objective is that every citizen must
be in a position to claim those rights. And secondly, these rights
must be binding upon every authority that has got the power
to make laws.
In addition to Fundamental Rights, the Constitution also has a
section called Directive Principles of State Policy. This section
was designed by the members of the Constituent Assembly to
ensure greater social and economic reforms, and to serve as a
guide to the independent Indian State to institute laws and
policies that help reduce the poverty of the masses.
Which Fundamental Rights will the following situations
violate:
- If a 13-year old child is working in a factory manufacturing
carpets.
- If a politician in one state decides to not allow labourers
from other states to work in his state.
- If a group of people are not given permission to open a
Telugu-medium school in Kerala.
- If the government decides not to promote an officer of the
armed forces for being a woman.
The Fundamental Rights in
the Indian Constitution
include:
1. Right to Equality: All persons are
equal before the law. This means
that all persons shall be equally
protected by the laws of the country.
It also states that no citizen can be
discriminated against on the basis of
their religion, caste or sex. Every
person has access to all public places
including playgrounds, hotels, shops
etc. The State cannot discriminate
against anyone in matters of
employment. But there are
exceptions to this that you will read
about later in this book. The practice
of untouchability has also been
abolished.
2. Right to Freedom: This includes
the right to freedom of speech and
expression, the right to form
associations, the right to move freely
and reside in any part of the country,
and the right to practise any
profession, occupation or business.
3. Right against Exploitation: The
Constitution prohibits human
trafficking, forced labour, and
employment of children under 14
years of age.
4. Right to Freedom of Religion:
Religious freedom is provided to all
citizens. Every person has the right
to practise, profess and propagate
the religion of their choice.
5. Cultural and Educational Rights:
The Constitution states that all
minorities, religious or linguistic, can
set up their own educational
institutions in order to preserve and
develop their own culture.
6. Right to Constitutional Remedies:
This allows citizens to move the
court if they believe that any of their
Fundamental Rights have been
violated by the State.

Ram, Labour Minister.
5. Secularism: A secular state is one in which the state does
not officially promote any one religion as the state religion.
We will read more about this in the following chapter.
You now understand the ways in which a country’s history
often determines the kind of Constitution that a country
adopts for itself. The Constitution plays a crucial role in laying
out the ideals that we would like all citizens of the country to
adhere to, including the representatives that we elect to rule
us. Just like in the game of football, a change of constitutive
rules will affect the game. Indian Constitution has been
amended over the years to reflect new concerns of the polity.
Often a major change in the Constitution means a change in
the fundamental nature of the country. We saw this in the case
of Nepal and how it needed to adopt a new
Constitution after it became a democracy.
The different features of the Indian Constitution
outlined above, involve complicated ideas that are
often not easy to grasp. Don’t worry too much
about this for the moment. In the rest of the book
as well as in your higher classes, you will read
more about these different features of the Indian
Constitution and understand more substantively
what they mean.
The Constitution also mentions Fundamental Duties. Find out
with the help of your teacher what these include and why it is
important for citizens in a democracy to observe these.

Chapter 2
Imagine yourself as a Hindu or Muslim living in a part
of the United States of America where Christian
fundamentalism is very powerful. Suppose that despite
being a US citizen, no one is willing to rent their house
to you. How would this make you feel? Would it not
make you feel resentful? What if you decided to
complain against this discrimination and were told to
go back to India. Would this not make you feel angry?
Your anger could take two forms. First, you might react
by saying that Christians should get the same treatment
in places where Hindus and Muslims are in a majority.
This is a form of retaliation. Or, you might take the
view that there should be justice for all. You may fight,
stating that no one should be discriminated against
on grounds of their religious practices and beliefs. This
statement rests on the assumption that all forms of
domination related to religion should end. This is the
essence of secularism. In this chapter, you will read
more about what this means in the Indian context.

Understanding Secularism
History provides us with many examples of discrimination,
exclusion and persecution on the grounds of religion. You
may have read about how Jews were persecuted in Hitler’s
Germany and how several millions were killed. Now, however,
the Jewish State of Israel treats its own Muslim and Christian
minorities quite badly. In Saudi Arabia, non-Muslims are not
allowed to build a temple, church etc., and nor can they gather
in a public place for prayers.
In all of the above examples, members of one religious
community either persecute or discriminate against
members of other religious communities. These acts of
discrimination take place more easily when one religion is
given official recognition by the State at the expense of other
religions. Clearly no one would wish to be discriminated against,
because of their religion nor dominated by another religion.
In India, can the State discriminate against citizens on the
grounds of their religion?
What is Secularism?
In the previous chapter, you read about how the Indian
Constitution contains Fundamental Rights that protect us
against State power as well as against the tyranny of the
majority. The Indian Constitution allows individuals the
freedom to live by their religious beliefs and practices as
they interpret these. In keeping with this idea of religious
freedom for all, India also adopted a strategy of separating
the power of religion and the power of the State. Secularism
refers to this separation of religion from the State.
Re-read the introduction to
this chapter. Why do you
think retaliation is not the
proper response to this
problem? What would
happen if different groups
followed this path?

Discuss in class: Can there be
different views within the same
religion?
Why is it Important to Separate Religion
from the State?
As discussed above, the most important aspect of secularism
is its separation of religion from State power. This is
important for a country to function democratically. Almost
all countries of the world will have more than one religious
group living in them. Within these religious groups, there
will most likely be one group that is in a majority. If this
majority religious group has access to State power, then it
could quite easily use this power and financial resources to
discriminate against and persecute persons of other
religions. This tyranny of the majority could result in the
discrimination, coercion and at times even the killing of
religious minorities. The majority could quite easily
prevent minorities from practising their religions. Any
form of domination based on religion is in violation of the
rights that a democratic society guarantees to each and every
citizen irrespective of their religion. Therefore, the tyranny
of the majority and the violation of Fundamental Rights
that can result is one reason why it is important to separate
the State and religion in democratic societies.
Another reason that it is important to separate religion
from the State in democratic societies is because we also
need to protect the freedom of individuals to exit from
their religion, embrace another religion or have the freedom
to interpret religious teachings differently. To understand
this point better, let us take the practice of untouchability.
You might feel that you dislike this practice within
Hinduism and therefore, you want to try and reform it.
However, if State power were in the hands of those Hindus
who support untouchability, then do you think that you
would have an easy task to try and change this? Even if you
were part of the dominant religious group, you might face
a lot of resistance from fellow members of your
community. These members who have control of State
power might say that there is only one interpretation of
Hinduism and that you do not have the freedom to interpret
this differently.

What is Indian Secularism?
The Indian Constitution mandates that the Indian State be
secular. According to the Constitution, only a secular State
can realise its objectives to ensure the following:
1. that one religious community does not dominate
another;
2. that some members do not dominate other members of
the same religious community;
3. that the State does not enforce any particular religion
nor take away the religious freedom of individuals.
The Indian State works in various ways to prevent the above
domination. First, it uses a strategy of distancing itself from
religion. The Indian State is not ruled by a religious group
and nor does it support any one religion. In India,
government spaces like law courts, police stations,
government schools and offices are not supposed to display
or promote any one religion.

In the above storyboard, the celebration of the religious
festival within the school would have been a violation of
the government’s policy of treating all religions equally.

either in their morning prayers or through religious
celebrations. This rule does not apply to private schools.

In the above storyboard, Paramjit, the Sikh youth, does not
have to wear a helmet. This is because the Indian State
recognises that wearing a pugri (turban) is central to a Sikh’s
religious practice and in order not to interfere with this,
allows an exception in the law.

the same religion (‘upper-caste’ Hindus) dominate other
members (some ‘lower castes’) within it. In order to
prevent this religion-based exclusion and discrimination
of ‘lower castes’, the Indian Constitution bans
untouchability. In this instance, the State is intervening in
religion in order to end a social practice that it believes
discriminates and excludes, and that violates the
Fundamental Rights of ‘lower castes’ who are citizens of
this country. Similarly, to ensure that laws relating to equal
inheritance rights are respected, the State may have to
intervene in the religion-based ‘personal laws’ of
communities.
The intervention of the State can also be in the form of
support. The Indian Constitution grants the right to
religious communities to set up their own schools and
colleges. It also gives them financial aid on a non-
preferential basis.
In what way is Indian secularism different from that of
other democratic countries?
Some of the above objectives are similar to those that have
been included in the Constitutions of secular democratic
countries in other parts of the world. For example, the First
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits the
legislature from making laws “respecting an establishment
of religion” or that “prohibit the free exercise of religion”.
What is meant by the word ‘establishment’ is that the
legislature cannot declare any religion as the official
religion. Nor can they give preference to one religion. In
the U.S.A. the separation between State and religion means
that neither the State nor religion can interfere in the affairs
of one another.
There is one significant way in which Indian secularism
differs from the dominant understanding of secularism as
practised in the United States of America. This is because
unlike the strict separation between religion and the State
in American secularism, in Indian secularism the State can
intervene in religious affairs. You have read about how the
In the United States of America, most children
in government schools have to begin their
school day reciting the ‘Pledge of Allegiance’.
This Pledge includes the words “under God”. It
was established more than 60 years ago that
government school students are not required to
recite the Pledge if it conflicts with their
religious beliefs. Despite this, there have been
several legal challenges objecting to the phrase
“under God” saying that it violates the
separation between church and State that the
First Amendment of the US Constitution
guarantees.

‘Pledge of Allegiance’ in a government school in

Indian Constitution intervened in Hindu religious practices
in order to abolish untouchability. In Indian secularism,
though the State is not strictly separate from religion it
does maintain a principled distance vis-à-vis religion. This
means that any interference in religion by the State has to
be based on the ideals laid out in the Constitution. These
ideals serve as the standard through which we can judge
whether the State is or is not behaving according to secular
principles.
The Indian State is secular and works in various ways to
prevent religious domination. The Indian Constitution
guarantees Fundamental Rights that are based on these
secular principles. However, this is not to say that there is
no violation of these rights in Indian society. Indeed it is
precisely because such violations happen frequently that
we need a constitutional mechanism to prevent them from
happening. The knowledge that such rights exist makes us
sensitive to their violations and enables us to take action
when these violations take place.
Can you think of a recent
incident, from any part of
India, in which the secular
ideals of the Constitution
were violated and persons
were persecuted and killed
because of their religious
backgrounds?
In February 2004, France passed a law banning students from wearing any conspicuous
religious or political signs or symbols such as the Islamic headscarf, the Jewish skullcap, or
large Christian crosses. This law has encountered a lot of resistance from immigrants who are
mainly from the former French colonies of Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. In the 1960s, France
had faced a shortage of workers and, therefore, had provided visas for these immigrants to come
and work in the country. The daughters of these immigrants often wear headscarves while
attending school. However, with the passing of this new law, they have been expelled from
their school for wearing headscarves.

Teacher’s Note
This is a continuation of the theme of government that has already been dealt with in the Class
VI and VII textbooks. Hence, a recap of ideas is important especially those related to elections,
representation and participation. These ideas can be made more clear to students through bringing
in actual examples into the classroom. Newspaper and TV reports could be used to facilitate this.
Chapter 3 discusses some of the functions of Parliament. The ways in which these connect to the
idea of parliamentary democracy need to be emphasised. Hence it is important to explain the
critical role played by citizens and allow students to air views regarding this. At times students
might be cynical about the political process and your role as a teacher is not to dismiss or agree
with this cynicism but rather redirect it towards what the Constitution intends.
Chapter 4 is on understanding laws. Children have little exposure to laws. Therefore, they
would require more examples from a familiar context. It is through this they can figure out
that laws are meant to apply in an equitable manner. The chapter begins by discussing how
this rule of law emerged and the ways in which the nationalists opposed the arbitrariness of
British laws.
The storyboard contained in Chapter 4 portrays how a new law comes into being. The focus of
this storyboard is not on the processes within Parliament. In contrast, the storyboard highlights
the important role that people play in transforming an urgent social issue into law. In addition
to the law already highlighted, it would be good to discuss another example of a new/contemplated
law so that students can relate to the role of people in bringing this about.
The chapter ends with a section on unpopular laws. These refer to laws that often restrict the
Fundamental Rights of certain populations. History provides us with examples of several groups
that protest what they view as unjust laws. Bring in these examples into the classroom to
discuss how a law can be unpopular. Allow students to research more examples in the Indian
context and debate these in the classroom using the Fundamental Rights listed in Chapter 1 as
their yardstick.

We in India pride ourselves on being a democracy.
Here we will try and understand the relation between
the ideas of participation in decision-making and
the need for all democratic governments to have the
consent of their citizens.
It is these elements that together make us a
democracy and this is best expressed in the institution
of the Parliament. In this chapter, we will try to see
how the Parliament enables citizens of India to
participate in decision making and control the
government, thus making it the most important
symbol of Indian democracy and a key feature of
the Constitution.

India, as we know, became independent on 15 August 1947.
Preceding this was a long and difficult struggle in which
many sections of society participated. People from various
backgrounds joined the struggle and they were inspired by
the ideas of freedom, equality and participation in decision–
making. Under colonial rule, the people had lived in fear
of the British government and did not agree with many of
the decisions that they took. But they faced grave danger if
they tried to criticise these decisions. The freedom
movement changed this situation. The nationalists began
to openly criticise the British government and make
demands. As far back as 1885, the Indian National Congress
demanded that there be elected members in the legislature
with a right to discuss the budget and ask questions. The
Government of India Act 1909, allowed for some elected
representation. While these early legislatures under the
British government were in response to the growing
demands of the nationalists, they did not allow for all adults
to vote nor could people participate in decision making.
As you read in Chapter 1, the experience of colonial rule as
well as the participation of different people in the struggle
for freedom left little doubt in the minds of the nationalists
that all persons in independent India would be able to
participate in making decisions. With the coming of
independence, we were going to be citizens of a free
country. This did not mean that the government could do
what it felt like, it meant that the government had to be
sensitive to people’s needs and demands. The dreams and
aspirations of the freedom struggle were made concrete in
the Constitution of independent India that laid down the
principle of universal adult franchise, i.e. that all adult
citizens of the country have the right to vote.

People and their Representatives
The take-off point for a democracy is the idea of consent, i.e.
the desire, approval and participation of people. It is the
decision of people that creates a democratic government and
decides about its functioning. The basic idea in this kind of
democracy is that the individual or the citizen is the most
important person and that in principle the government as well
as other public institutions need to have the trust of these
citizens.
How does the individual give approval to the government? One
way of doing so, as you read, is through elections. People would
elect their representatives to the Parliament, then, one group
from among these elected representatives forms the government.
The Parliament, which is made up of all representatives together,
controls and guides the government. In this sense people, through
their chosen representatives, form the government and also
control it.

there should be universal adult
franchise.

The Role of the Parliament
Created after 1947, the Indian Parliament is an expression of the
faith that the people of India have in principles of democracy.
These are participation by people in the decision-making process
and government by consent. The Parliament in our system has
immense powers because it is the representative of the people.
Elections to the Parliament are held in a similar manner as they
are for the state legislature. The Lok Sabha is usually elected
once every five years. The country is divided into numerous
constituencies as shown in the map on page 41. Each of these
constituencies elects one person to the Parliament. The candidates
who contest elections usually belong to different political parties.

Once elected, these candidates become Members
of Parliament or MPs. These MPs together make
up the Parliament. Once elections to the
Parliament have taken place, the Parliament needs
to perform the following functions:
A. To Select the National Government
Parliament of India consists of the President, the Rajya
Sabha and the Lok Sabha. After the Lok Sabha elections,
a list is prepared showing how many MPs belong to
each political party. For a political party to form the
government, they must have a majority of elected MPs.
Since there are 543 elected (plus 2 Anglo-Indian
nominated) members in Lok Sabha, to have a majority
a party should have at least half the number i.e. 272
members or more. The Opposition in Parliament is
formed by all the political parties that oppose the
majority party/coalition formed. The largest amongst
these parties is called the Opposition party.
One of the most important functions of the Lok
Sabha is to select the executive. The executive, as
you read in Chapter 1, is a group of persons who
work together to implement the laws made by the
Parliament. This executive is often what we have
in mind when we use the term government.
The Prime Minister of India is the leader of the
ruling party in the Lok Sabha. From the MPs who
belong to her party, the Prime Minister selects
ministers to work with her to implement
decisions. These ministers then take charge of
different areas of government functioning like
health, education, finance etc.
Often times in the recent past it has been difficult
for a single political party to get the majority that
is required to form the government. They then
join together with different political parties who
are interested in similar concerns to form what is
known as a coalition government.

The above table gives you the results of the 15th
Lok Sabha elections held in 2009. In these
elections, the INC got a large number of seats but
still not enough to emerge as the majority party in
the Lok Sabha. It, thus, had to form a coalition,
the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), with other
political parties who were its allies.

The Rajya Sabha functions primarily as the representative
of the states of India in the Parliament. The Rajya Sabha
can also initiate legislation and a bill is required to pass
through the Rajya Sabha in order to become a law. It,
therefore, has an important role of reviewing and altering
(if alterations are needed) the laws initiated by the Lok
Sabha. The members of the Rajya Sabha are elected by the
elected members of the Legislative Assemblies of various
states. There are 233 elected members plus 12 members
nominated by the President.
B. To Control, Guide and Inform the Government
The Parliament, while in session, begins with a question hour.
The question hour is an important mechanism through which
MPs can elicit information about the working of the
government. This is a very important way through which
the Parliament controls the executive. By asking questions
the government is alerted to its shortcomings, and also comes
to know the opinion of the people through their
representatives in the Parliament, i.e. the MPs. Asking
questions of the government is a crucial task for every MP.
The Opposition parties play a critical role in the healthy
functioning of a democracy. They highlight drawbacks in
various policies and programmes of the government and
mobilise popular support for their own policies.
These two buildings of the Central Secretariat, the South Block and North Block were built during the 1930s. The photo on the left is of the South
Block which houses the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of External Affairs. The North Block is the photo on
the right and this has the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Home Affairs. The other ministries of the Union Government are located in various
buildings in New Delhi.

The government gets valuable feedback and is kept on its
toes by the questions asked by the MPs. In addition, in all
matters dealing with finances, the Parliament’s approval is
crucial for the government. This is one of the several ways
in which the Parliament controls, guides and informs the
government. The MPs as representatives of the people have
a central role in controlling, guiding and informing
Parliament and this is a key aspect of the functioning of
Indian democracy.

C. Law-Making
Law-making is a significant function of Parliament. We shall
read about this in the next chapter.
Who are the People in Parliament?
Parliament now has more and more people from different
backgrounds. For example, there are more rural members as
also members from many regional parties. Groups and peoples
that were till now unrepresented are beginning to get elected
to Parliament.
There has also been an increase in political participation from
the Dalits and backward classes. Let us look at the following
table that shows the percentage of the population who voted
in Lok Sabha elections in different years.
Looking at this table would
you say that people’s
participation during the past
65 years has:
decreased/increased/been
stable after initial increase?
It has been observed that representative democracy cannot
produce a perfect reflection of society. There is a realisation
that when interests and experiences separate us it is
important to ensure that communities that have been
historically marginalised are given adequate representation.
With this in mind, some seats are reserved in Parliament for
SCs and STs. This has been done so that the MPs elected from
these constituencies will be familiar with and can represent Dalit
and Adivasi interests in Parliament.

Similarly, it has more recently been suggested that there should
be reservation of seats for women. This issue is still being
debated. Sixty years ago, only four per cent of MPs were women
and today it is just above eleven per cent. This is a small share
when you consider the fact that half the population are women.
It is issues of this kind that force the country to ask certain
difficult and often unresolved questions about whether our
democratic system is representative enough. The fact that
we can ask these questions and are working towards
answers is a reflection of the strength and the faith that
people in India have in a democratic form of government.
Why do you think there are so
few women in Parliament?
Discuss.
GLOSSARY
Approval: To give one’s consent to and be favourable towards something. In the
context of this chapter, it refers both to the formal consent (through elected
representatives) that Parliament has as well as the fact that it needs to continue
to enjoy the people’s trust.
Coalition: A temporary alliance of groups or parties. In this chapter, it refers to the
alliance formed by political parties after elections when no party has been able to
get adequate seats to form a clear majority.
Unresolved: Situations in which there are no easy solutions to problems.

Understanding Laws
Q
Read the following situation and answer the questions
that follow.
A government official helps his son go into hiding because
his son has been given a ten-year jail sentence by a District
Court for a crime that he has committed.
Do you think that the government official’s actions were
right? Should his son be exempt from the law just because
his father is economically and politically powerful?
Do Laws Apply to All?
The above is a clear case of the violation of law. As you
read in Unit 1, members of the Constituent Assembly were
agreed there should be no arbitrary exercise of power in
independent India. They, therefore, instituted several
provisions in the Constitution that would establish the rule
of law. The most important of these was that all persons in
independent India are equal before the law.
The law cannot discriminate between persons on the basis
of their religion, caste or gender. What the rule of law means
is that all laws apply equally to all citizens of the country
and no one can be above the law. Neither a government
official, nor a wealthy person nor even the President of the
country is above the law. Any crime or violation of law
has a specific punishment as well as a process through which
the guilt of the person has to be established. But was it
always like this?
In ancient India, there were innumerable and often
overlapping local laws. Different communities enjoyed
different degrees of autonomy in administering these laws

among their own. In some cases, the punishment that two
persons received for the same crime varied depending on
their caste backgrounds, with lower castes being more
harshly penalised. This slowly began to change as this system
of law began to further evolve during the colonial period.
It is often believed that it was the British colonialists who
introduced the rule of law in India. Historians have
disputed this claim on several grounds, two of which
include: first that colonial law was arbitrary, and second
that the Indian nationalists played a prominent role in the
development of the legal sphere in British India. One
example of the arbitrariness that continued to exist as part
of British law is the Sedition Act of 1870. The idea of
sedition was very broadly understood within this Act. Any
person protesting or criticising the British government
could be arrested without due trial.
Indian nationalists began protesting and criticising this
arbitrary use of authority by the British. They also began
fighting for greater equality and wanted to change the idea
Another example of British arbitrariness was
the Rowlatt Act which allowed the British
government to imprison people without due
trial. Indian nationalists including Mahatma
Gandhi were vehement in their opposition to
the Rowlatt bills. Despite the large number of
protests, the Rowlatt Act came into effect on
10 March 1919. In Punjab, protests against
this Act continued quite actively and on April
10 two leaders of the movement, Dr Satyapal
and Dr Saifuddin Kitchlew were arrested. To
protest these arrests, a public meeting was
held on 13 April at Jallianwala Bagh in
Amritsar. General Dyer entered the park with
his troops. They closed the only exit and
without giving any warning General Dyer
ordered the troops to fire. Several hundreds of
people died in this gunfire and many more were
wounded including women and children. This
painting shows troops firing on the people
during the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.

The word ‘arbitrary’ has been
used earlier in this book and
you’ve read what the word
means in the Glossary of
Chapter 1. The word ‘sedition’
has been included in the
Glossary of this chapter. Read
the Glossary descriptions of
both words and then answer
the following questions:
State one reason why you think
the Sedition Act of 1870 was
arbitrary? In what ways does
the Sedition Act of 1870
contradict the rule of law?
Domestic violence refers to the injury or harm or threat of injury or harm caused by an
adult male, usually the husband, against his wife. Injury may be caused by physically
beating up the woman or by emotionally abusing her. Abuse of the woman can also
include verbal, sexual and economic abuse. The Protection of Women from Domestic
Violence Act 2005 extends the understanding of the term ‘domestic’ to include all
women who ‘live or have lived together in a shared household’ with the male member
who is perpetrating the violence.
of law from a set of rules that they were forced to obey, to law
as including ideas of justice. By the end of the nineteenth century,
the Indian legal profession also began emerging and demanded
respect in colonial courts. They began to use law to defend the
legal rights of Indians. Indian judges also began to play a greater
role in making decisions. Therefore, there were several ways in
which Indians played a major role in the evolution of the rule of
law during the colonial period.
With the adoption of the Constitution, this document served
as the foundation on which our representatives began making
laws for the country. Every year our representatives pass several
new laws as well as amend existing ones. In your Class VI book,
you read about the Hindu Succession Amendment Act 2005.
According to this new law, sons, daughters and their mothers
can get an equal share of family property. Similarly, new laws
have been enacted to control pollution and provide
employment. How do people come to think and propose that
a new law is necessary? You will read more about this in the
next section.
How Do New Laws Come About?
The Parliament has an important role in making laws.
There are many ways through which this takes place
and it is often different groups in society that raise
the need for a particular law. An important role of
Parliament is to be sensitive to the problems faced
by people. Let us read the following story to
understand how issue of domestic violence was
brought to the attention of Parliament and the
process adopted for this issue to become law.

April 1991: A typical day at their office...
Throughout the 1990s, the need for a new law was
raised in different forums.
In 1999, Lawyers Collective, a group of lawyers, law students and
activists, after nation-wide consultations took the lead in
drafting the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill.
This draft bill was widely circulated.
Kusum and Shazia work for a
women's organisation. They
remember the journey of how
the Protection of Women
from Domestic Violence Act
got passed.
October 2006
Shazia, did you read today’s
newspapers? Isn’t it a great
day for women?
Not just women. Violence-free homes
will benefit everyone. Kusum, it’s taken
such a long time to get this law passed.
In fact, it began with establishing the
need for a new law.
I need advice. My husband beats me
up. I haven’t told anyone so far. I feel
so ashamed. I can’t go on like this
anymore. But I have nowhere to go.
I am being
ill-treated by my
son and daughter-
in-law. They
verbally abuse me. I
have no access to
my bank accounts.
They may even
throw me out.
I do not want to go to
the police. I just want
to stop the violence.
I just don’t want to
be thrown out of the
house I am living in.
Unfortunately
the existing law
is a criminal one
and does not offer
these options.
 We’ve heard testimonies of several women.
We’ve seen that women want protection
against being beaten, the right to continue
living in a shared household and often
temporary relief. We need a new civil law to
address this issue.
The law should cover any women
living within a shared domestic space.
They should be protected from being
evicted from the shared household.
What about some
monetary relief?
The definition of
domestic violence
should include
physical, economic,
sexual and verbal and
emotional abuse.

Finally, the Bill was introduced in Parliament in 2002 but …
In December 2002, the Standing
Committee submitted its
recommendations to the Rajya Sabha and
these were also tabled in the Lok Sabha.
The Committee’s report accepted most of
the demands of the women’s groups.
Finally a new bill, was reintroduced in
Parliament in 2005. After being passed in
both houses of Parliament, it was sent to
the President for his assent. The
Protection of Women from Domestic
Violence Act came into effect in 2006.
At a press conference in
October 2006
Meetings were held with different organisations.
This law is a first in recognising a
woman’s right to a violence-free
home and provides a comprehensive
definition of domestic violence.
The women’s movement want a
new law on Domestic Violence.
The Government should introduce
it in parliament soon.
This Bill has
none of what
we have been
suggesting.
We must oppose
the Bill in its
present form.
The law needs to provide

children …
What is this new law?
This is a civil law aimed at
providing relief to millions of
women, including wives,
mothers, daughters and
sisters affected by violence
in their homes.
Let’s have a press
conference … we
could also start an
on-line petition.
Several women’s organisations, National Commission for Women
made submissions to the Parliamentary Standing Committee.
Esteemed members of the Parliamentary
Standing Committee... the present Bill must be
changed. We do not agree with the definition
of domestic violence being proposed …

What do you understand by ‘domestic violence’? List the
two rights that the new law helped achieve for women who
are survivors of violence.
Can you list one process that was used to make more people
aware of the need for this law?
From the above storyboard, can you list two different ways in
which people lobbied Parliament?
Often women who face
violence or are abused are
seen as victims. But women
struggle in several different
ways to survive these
situations. Therefore, it is
more accurate to refer to
them as survivors rather
than as victims.
In the following poster, what
do you understand by the
phrase ‘Equal Relationships are
Violence Free’?
Yes, now the government
has to ensure that this
law is implemented and
enforced.
Now begins another
long journey …
This law is a very significant step because it
recognises ... The right of women to live in a
shared household... women can get a
protection order against any further
violence... Women can get monetary relief to
meet their expenses including medical costs.
Why is this an
important law?

As the above example shows, the role of citizens is crucial
in helping Parliament frame different concerns that people
might have into laws. From establishing the need for a new
law to its being passed, at every stage of the process the
voice of the citizen is a crucial element. This voice can be
heard through TV reports, newspaper editorials, radio
broadcasts, local meetings - all of which help in making the
work that Parliament does more accessible and transparent
to the people.
Unpopular and Controversial Laws
Let us now look at the situation where the Parliament passes
laws that turn out to be very unpopular. Sometimes a law
can be constitutionally valid and hence legal, but it can
continue to be unpopular and unacceptable to people
because they feel that the intention behind it is unfair and
harmful. Hence, people might criticise this law, hold public
meetings, write about it in newspapers, report to TV news
channels etc. In a democracy like ours, citizens can express
their unwillingness to accept repressive laws framed by the
Parliament. When a large number of people begin to feel
that a wrong law has been passed, then there is pressure on
the Parliament to change this.
For example, various municipal laws on the use of space
within municipal limits often make hawking and street
vending illegal. No one will dispute the necessity for some
rules to keep the public space open so that people can walk
on the pavements easily. However, one also cannot deny
that hawkers and vendors provide essential services cheaply
and efficiently to the millions living in a large city. This is
their means of livelihood. Hence, if the law favours one
group and disregards the other it will be controversial and
lead to conflict. People who think that the law is not fair
can approach the court to decide on the issue. The court
has the power to modify or cancel laws if it finds that they
don’t adhere to the Constitution.
As you read in the earlier section
on the rule of law, Indian
nationalists protested and
criticised arbitrary and
repressive laws being enforced
by the British. History provides
us with several examples of
people and communities who
have struggled to end unjust
laws. In your Class VII book, you
read of how Rosa Parks, an
African-American woman,
refused to give up her seat on a
bus to a white man on 1
December 1955. She was
protesting the law on
segregation that divided up all
public spaces, including the
streets, between the whites and
the African-Americans. Her
refusal was a key event that
marked the start of the Civil
Rights Movement, which led to
the Civil Rights Act in 1964,
which prohibited discrimination
on the basis of race, religion or
national origin in the U.S.A.

Read the newspapers/watch
news on TV for a week and
find out if there are any
unpopular laws that people
in India or around the world
are currently protesting.
List the three forms of protest
that you see in the above
photos.
Do you remember the photo essay on the women’s
movement in the Class VII book? The photos there showed
the different ways in which citizens can protest, campaign
and show solidarity. The following pictures point to other
ways in which people protest unjust laws:
We need to remember that our role as citizens does not
end with electing our representatives. Rather, it is then that
we begin to use newspapers and the media to carefully chart
the work that is being done by our MPs and criticise their
actions when we feel it is required. Thus, what we should
bear in mind is that it is the extent, involvement and
enthusiasm of the people that helps Parliament perform its
representative functions properly.

Criticise: To find fault with or disapprove of a person or thing. In the context of this
chapter, it refers to citizens finding fault with the functioning of government.
Evolution: Process of development from a simple to a complex form and is often used
to discuss the development of a species of plants or animals. In the context of this
chapter it refers to the way in which protecting women against domestic violence
developed from an urgently-felt need to a new law that can be enforced throughout
the country.
Sedition: This applies to anything that the government might consider as stirring up
resistance or rebellion against it. In such cases, the government does not need
absolute evidence in order to arrest persons. Under the Sedition Act of 1870, the
British had a very broad interpretation of what constituted sedition, and what this
meant was that they could arrest and detain any person they wanted under this Act.
The nationalists considered this law arbitrary because persons were arrested for a
variety of reasons that were seldom clarified beforehand as well as because those
arrested were often kept in jail without a trial.
Repressive: To control severely in order to prevent free and natural development or
expression. In the context of this chapter it refers to laws that brutally control
persons and often prevent them from exercising their Fundamental Rights including
Right to Speech and Assembly.

Teacher’s Note
Students are going to be introduced to the judiciary through these chapters. Yet, aspects of this
system like the police, the courts etc. are probably something that students are already quite
familiar with either through the media or perhaps through personal experience. In this unit, the
effort is to combine some basic knowledge on the judicial system with more hands-on
information on the criminal justice system. Chapter 5 covers topics that will be reinforced in
the higher classes. The effort while teaching this should be to provide students with a sense of
the significant role played by the judiciary in upholding the principles enshrined in the
Constitution. Chapter 6 explains the role of different individuals in the criminal justice system
and here it is crucial that students understand the connection between each person’s role and
the idea of justice for all that the Constitution provides.
Before starting Chapter 5, it might be useful to reiterate the discussion on the ‘rule of law’ from
the previous unit. This can then lead to a discussion on the role of the judiciary in upholding the
rule of law. Five separate though inter-related concepts on the judiciary have been discussed in
Chapter 5. The reason why the independence of the judiciary is key to its functioning is a
complex idea but something that students need to understand. This can be conveyed at a more
basic level using examples of different decision-making processes that the student is familiar
with. The structure has been illustrated through a case and students should be encouraged to
discuss other cases to better understand the working of the judicial process. The last concept of
‘access to justice’ highlights the role of the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in facilitating justice.
It also touches upon the ‘delay’ in providing justice. The student’s growing knowledge of
Fundamental Rights should be used while discussing this section.
Chapter 6 has been included in order to make students more aware of the role played by different
persons in the criminal justice system and the process that needs to be followed in order to
ensure a fair trial. The chapter takes as its starting point a storyboard in which a case of theft is
highlighted and uses this as the reference point to discuss the roles of the police, the public
prosecutor, the judge, as well as what a fair trial should include. It is very likely that the students
will have their own opinions, which might be quite cynical, on the ways in which the criminal
justice system works. Your role as a teacher will be to balance their cynicism with a discussion
of the ideal as outlined in the chapter. This can be done in two ways: one, through a continued
emphasis on the link between this ideal functioning and the principles enshrined in the Indian
Constitution as discussed in earlier chapters, and two, through emphasising the difference that
an informed and aware public can make in the working of these institutions. The discussion of
the criminal justice system is to help students understand this better and not for them to learn
this by rote.

Chapter 5
A glance at the newspaper provides you a glimpse of
the range of work done by the courts in this country.
But can you think of why we need these courts? As
you have read in Unit 2, in India we have the rule of
law. What this means is that laws apply equally to
all persons and that a certain set of fixed procedures
need to be followed when a law is violated. To enforce
this rule of law, we have a judicial system that
consists of the mechanism of courts that a citizen
can approach when a law is violated. As an organ of
government, the judiciary plays a crucial role in the
functioning of India’s democracy. It can play this
role only because it is independent. What does an
‘independent judiciary’ mean? Is there any connection
between the court in your area and the Supreme
Court in New Delhi? In this chapter, you will find
answers to these questions.

Judiciary
The Supreme Court was established on
26 January 1950, the day India became a
Republic. Like its predecessor, the Federal Court
of India (1937–1949), it was earlier located in
the Chamber of Princes in the Parliament House.
It moved to its present building on Mathura Road
in New Delhi in 1958.
Courts take decisions on a very large number of issues.
They can decide that no teacher can beat a student, or about
the sharing of river waters between states, or they can punish
people for particular crimes. Broadly speaking, the work
that the judiciary does can be divided into the following:
Dispute Resolution: The judicial system provides a mechanism
for resolving disputes between citizens, between citizens and
the government, between two state governments and between
the centre and state governments.
Judicial Review: As the final interpreter of the Constitution,
the judiciary also has the power to strike down particular laws
passed by the Parliament if it believes that these are a violation
of the basic structure of the Constitution. This is called judicial
review.
Upholding the Law and Enforcing Fundamental Rights:
Every citizen of India can approach the Supreme Court or the
High Court if they believe that their Fundamental Rights have
been violated. For example, in the Class VII book, you read
about Hakim Sheikh, an agricultural labourer who fell from a
running train and injured himself and whose condition got worse
because several hospitals refused to admit him. On hearing his
case, the Supreme Court ruled that Article 21 which provides
every citizen the Fundamental Right to Life also includes the
Right to Health. It, therefore, directed the West Bengal
government to pay him compensation for the loss suffered
as well as to come up with a blueprint for primary health
care with particular reference to treatment of patients during
an emergency [Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samity vs State of West
Bengal (1996)].

What is an Independent Judiciary?
Imagine a situation in which a powerful politician has
encroached on land belonging to your family. Within this
judicial system, the politician has the power to appoint and
dismiss a judge from his office. When you take this case to
court, the judge is clearly partial to the politician.
The control that the politician holds over the judge does not
allow for the judge to take an independent decision. This lack
of independence would force the judge to make all judgments
in favour of the politician. Although we often hear of rich and
powerful people in India trying to influence the judicial process,
the Indian Constitution protects against this kind of situation
by providing for the independence of the judiciary.
One aspect of this independence is the ‘separation of powers’.
This, as you read in Chapter 1, is a key feature of the
Constitution. What this means here is that other branches
of government – the legislature and the executive – cannot
interfere in the work of the judiciary. The courts are not under
the government and do not act on their behalf.
For the above separation to work well, it is also crucial that all
judges in the High Court as well as the Supreme Court are
appointed with very little interference from these other branches
of government. Once appointed to this office, it is also very
difficult to remove a judge.
Do you think that any ordinary
citizen stands a chance against
a politician in this kind of
judicial system? Why not?

List two reasons why you
believe an independent
judiciary is essential to
democracy.
It is the independence of the judiciary that allows the courts to
play a central role in ensuring that there is no misuse of power
by the legislature and the executive. It also plays a crucial role
in protecting the Fundamental Rights of citizens because anyone
can approach the courts if they believe that their rights have
been violated.
What is the Structure of Courts in India?
There are three different levels of courts in our country.
There are several courts at the lower level while there is
only one at the apex level. The courts that most people
interact with are what are called subordinate or district
courts. These are usually at the district or Tehsil level or in
towns and they hear many kinds of cases. Each state is
divided into districts that are presided over by a District
Judge. Each state has a High Court which is the highest
court of that state. At the top is the Supreme Court that is
located in New Delhi and is presided over by the Chief
Justice of India. The decisions made by the Supreme Court
are binding on all other courts in India.
The structure of the courts from the lower to the highest level is such that it
resembles a pyramid. Having read the description above, can you fill out which
type of courts would exist at what level in the following diagram?

169,Social Science - History,Class 9,General Social Studies,General Social Studies - Class 9,3,"As we live our life in the present and read about the happenings around the world in
newspapers, we do not usually pause to think about the longer history of these
events. We see change before our eyes, but do not always ask, why are things changing?
Very often we do not even notice that things were not the same in the past. History
is about tracking these changes, understanding how and why they are taking place,
how the present world in which we live has evolved.
The focus of the history books of Classes IX and X is on the emergence of the contemporary
world. In earlier classes (VI – VIII) you have read about the history of India. In the next
two years (Classes IX and X) you will see how the story of India’s pasts is related to the
larger history of the world. We cannot understand what was happening within India unless
we see this connection. This is particularly true about a world in which economies and
societies have become increasingly inter-connected. History cannot be always contained
within defined territorial boundaries.
In any case there is no reason to think of national territorial boundaries as the only valid unit
of our study. There are times when a focus on a small region - a locality, a village, an island,
a desert tract, a forest, a mountain - helps us understand the rich variety in people’s lives and
histories that make up the life of the nation. We cannot talk of the nation without the
people, nor the locality without the nation. Borrowing from the statement of a famous
French historian, Fernand Braudel, we may also say: it is not possible to talk of the nation
without the world.
The textbooks you will read in the next two years will combine these different levels of
focus. We move between a close focus on particular communities and regions to the
history of the nation; between the histories as they unfold in India and Europe to the
developments in Africa and Indonesia. Our focus will shift according
to themes.
What are these themes and how are they organised? What is the logic behind the
choices of themes?
All too often in the past, the history of the modern world was associated with the
history of the west. It was as if change and progress happened only in the west. As if
the histories of other countries were frozen in time, they were motionless and static.
People in the west were seen as enterprising, innovative, scientific, industrious, efficient
and willing to change. People in the east - or in Africa and South America - were
considered traditional, lazy, superstitious, and resistant to change.
For many years now these notions have been questioned by historians. We know
now that every society has had its history of change. So in understanding the making
of the modern world we have to look at the way different societies experienced and

170,Social Science - History,Class 9,General Social Studies,General Social Studies - Class 9,3,"fashioned these changes. We have to see how the histories of these different countries
were inter-linked. Changes in one society shaped the other; developments in India and
other colonies impacted on Europe. The contemporary world was not shaped by the
west alone.
So the history of the contemporary world is not only about the growth of
industries and trade, technology and science, railways and roads. It is equally
about the forest dwellers and pastoralists, shifting cultivators and small peasants.
All these social groups in diverse ways have played their part in making the
contemporary world what it is. And it is this varied world which you will learn
about this year.
Section I, in both books, focuses on some of the events and processes that are
critical to the understanding of the modern world. This year you will read
about the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution and Nazism in this
section. Next year you will know about nationalism and anti-colonial movements
in India and elsewhere.
Section II will move from dramatic events to the routines of people’s lives – their
economic activities and livelihood patterns. You will see what the contemporary
world has meant for forest people and pastoralists; and how they have coped
with and defined the nature of these changes. Next year you will read more
about the processes of industrialisation and urbanisation, capitalism
and colonialism.
True, we read a lot about such issues. But what we read does not tell us about
their histories. They give us no idea of how things have evolved and why they
change. Once we learn to ask historical questions about all that is around us,
history in fact acquires a new meaning. It allows us to see everyday things from
a different angle. We realise that even seemingly ordinary things have a history
that is important for us to know.
To know how the contemporary world has evolved we will therefore move
from India to Africa, from Europe to Indonesia. We will read both about the
big events and important ideas, as well as everyday life. In the process of these
journeys you will discover how history can be exciting, how it can help us
understand the world in which we live.

revised over many months. We would like to thank all those who have
participated in these discussions.
A large number of people have read individual chapters of the book. We
thank in particular the members of the Monitoring Committee who
commented on an earlier draft; Narayani Gupta and Kumkum Roy who
provided constant encouragement and support, and Richard Evans who read
the Chapter on Nazism. We have tried to incorporate most of the suggestions
that have been made on the manuscript.
Illustrating the book would have been impossible without the help of many
institutions and individuals. The Maasai Association, the North Dakota State
University Libraries, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the
UNESCO PARZOR project and the Centre for Women’s Development
Studies, New Delhi provided photographs and reproductions from their
archive at very short notice. Some of the pictures have been accessed from
the collections of the Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division,
the Jewish Historical Institute, Warsaw, Poland, Rabindra Bhawan Photo

In Section I, you will read about the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution,
and the rise of Nazism. In different ways all these events were important in the
making of the modern world.
Chapter I is on the French Revolution. Today we often take the ideas of liberty,
freedom and equality for granted. But we need to remind ourselves that these ideas
also have a history. By looking at the French Revolution you will read a small part
of that history. The French Revolution led to the end of monarchy in France. A
society based on privileges gave way to a new system of governance. The Declaration
of the Rights of Man during the revolution, announced the coming of a new time.
The idea that all individuals had rights and could claim equality became part of a
new language of politics. These notions of equality and freedom emerged as the central
ideas of a new age; but in different countries they were reinterpreted and rethought
in many different ways. The anti-colonial movements in India and China, Africa and
South America, produced ideas that were innovative and original, but they spoke in
a language that gained currency only from the late eighteenth century.
In Chapter II, you will read about the coming of socialism in Europe, and the dramatic
events that forced the ruling monarch, Tsar Nicholas II, to give up power. The Russian
Revolution sought to change society in a different way. It raised the question of
economic equality and the well-being of workers and peasants. The chapter will tell
you about the changes that were initiated by the new Soviet government, the problems
it faced and the measures it undertook. While Soviet Russia pushed ahead with
industrialisation and mechanisation of agriculture, it denied the rights of citizens
that were essential to the working of a democratic society. The ideals of socialism,

however, became part of the anti-colonial movements in different countries. Today
the Soviet Union has broken up and socialism is in crisis but through the twentieth
century it has been a powerful force in the shaping of the contemporary world.
Chapter III will take you to Germany. It will discuss the rise of Hitler and the
politics of Nazism. You will read about the children and women in Nazi Germany,
about schools and concentration camps. You will see how Nazism denied various
minorities a right to live, how it drew upon a long tradition of anti-Jewish feelings
to persecute the Jews, and how it waged a relentless battle against democracy and
socialism. But the story of Nazism’s rise is not only about a few specific events,
about massacres and killings. It is about the working of an elaborate and frightening
system which operated at different levels. Some in India were impressed with the
ideas of Hitler but most watched the rise of Nazism with horror.
The history of the modern world is not simply a story of the unfolding of freedom
and democracy. It has also been a story of violence and tyranny, death and destruction.

On the morning of 14 July 1789, the city of Paris was in a state of
alarm. The king had commanded troops to move into the city. Rumours
spread that he would soon order the army to open fire upon the citizens.
Some 7,000 men and women gathered in front of the town hall and
decided to form a peoples’ militia. They broke into a number of
government buildings in search of arms.
Finally, a group of several hundred people marched towards the eastern
part of the city and stormed the fortress-prison, the Bastille, where they
hoped to find hoarded ammunition. In the armed fight that followed,
the commander of the Bastille was killed and the prisoners released –
though there were only seven of them. Yet the Bastille was hated by all,
because it stood for the despotic power of the king. The fortress was
demolished and its stone fragments were sold in the markets to all
those who wished to keep a souvenir of its destruction.
The days that followed saw more rioting both in Paris and the
countryside. Most people were protesting against the high price of bread.
Much later, when historians looked back upon this time, they saw it as
the beginning of a chain of events that ultimately led to the execution
of the king in France, though most people at the time did not anticipate
this outcome. How and why did this happen?

In 1774, Louis XVI of the Bourbon family of kings ascended the
throne of France. He was 20 years old and married to the Austrian
princess Marie Antoinette. Upon his accession the new king found
an empty treasury. Long years of war had drained the financial
resources of France. Added to this was the cost of maintaining an
extravagant court at the immense palace of Versailles. Under Louis
XVI, France helped the thirteen American colonies to gain their
independence from the common enemy, Britain. The war added more
than a billion livres to a debt that had already risen to more than 2
billion livres. Lenders who gave the state credit, now began to charge
10 per cent interest on loans. So the French government was obliged
to spend an increasing percentage of its budget on interest payments
alone. To meet its regular expenses, such as the cost of maintaining
an army, the court, running government offices or universities, the
state was forced to increase taxes. Yet even this measure would not
have sufficed. French society in the eighteenth century was divided
into three estates, and only members of the third estate paid taxes.
The society of estates was part of the feudal system that dated back to
the middle ages. The term Old Regime is usually used to describe the
society and institutions of France before 1789.
Fig. 2 shows how the system of estates in French society was organised.
Peasants made up about 90 per cent of the population. However,
only a small number of them owned the land they cultivated. About
60 per cent of the land was owned by nobles, the Church and other
richer members of the third estate. The members of the first two
estates, that is, the clergy and the nobility, enjoyed certain privileges by
birth. The most important of these was exemption from paying taxes to
the state. The nobles further enjoyed feudal privileges. These included
feudal dues, which they extracted from the peasants. Peasants were obliged
to render services to the lord – to work in his house and fields – to serve
in the army or to participate in building roads.
The Church too extracted its share of taxes called tithes from the peasants,
and finally, all members of the third estate had to pay taxes to the state.
These included a direct tax, called taille, and a number of indirect taxes
which were levied on articles of everyday consumption like salt or tobacco.
The burden of financing activities of the state through taxes was borne
by the third estate alone.

1.1 The Struggle to Survive
The population of France rose from about 23 million in 1715 to 28
million in 1789. This led to a rapid increase in the demand for
foodgrains. Production of grains could not keep pace with the
demand. So the price of bread which was the staple diet of the majority
rose rapidly. Most workers were employed as labourers in workshops
whose owner fixed their wages. But wages did not keep pace with
the rise in prices. So the gap between the poor and the rich widened.
Things became worse whenever drought or hail reduced the harvest.
This led to a subsistence crisis, something that occurred frequently
in France during the Old Regime.

1.3 A Growing Middle Class Envisages an End to Privileges
In the past, peasants and workers had participated in revolts against
increasing taxes and food scarcity. But they lacked the means and
programmes to carry out full-scale measures that would bring about
a change in the social and economic order. This was left to those
groups within the third estate who had become prosperous and had
access to education and new ideas.
The eighteenth century witnessed the emergence of social groups,
termed the middle class, who earned their wealth through an
expanding overseas trade and from the manufacture of goods such as
woollen and silk textiles that were either exported or bought by the
richer members of society. In addition to merchants and
manufacturers, the third estate included professions such as lawyers
or administrative officials. All of these were educated and believed
that no group in society should be privileged by birth. Rather, a
person’s social position must depend on his merit. These ideas
envisaging a society based on freedom and equal laws and
opportunities for all, were put forward by philosophers such as John
Locke and Jean Jacques Rousseau. In his Two Treatises of Government,
Locke sought to refute the doctrine of the divine and absolute right

Accounts of lived experiences in the Old Regime
1. Georges Danton, who later became active in revolutionary politics, wrote to a friend in
1793, looking back upon the time when he had just completed his studies:
‘I was educated in the residential college of Plessis. There I was in the company of
important men … Once my studies ended, I was left with nothing. I started looking for a
post. It was impossible to find one at the law courts in Paris. The choice of a career in the
army was not open to me as I was not a noble by birth, nor did I have a patron. The
church too could not offer me a refuge. I could not buy an office as I did not possess a
sou. My old friends turned their backs to me … the system had provided us with an
education without however offering a field where our talents could be utilised.’
2. An Englishman, Arthur Young, travelled through France during the years from 1787 to
1789 and wrote detailed descriptions of his journeys. He often commented on what he
saw.
‘He who decides to be served and waited upon by slaves, ill-treated slaves at that, must
be fully aware that by doing so he is placing his property and his life in a situation which is
very different from that he would be in, had he chosen the services of free and well-
treated men. And he who chooses to dine to the accompaniment of his victims’ groans,
should not complain if during a riot his daughter gets kidnapped or his son’s throat is slit.’

Who is he criticising? What dangers does he sense in the situation of 1787?

of the monarch. Rousseau carried the idea forward, proposing a
form of government based on a social contract between people
and their representatives. In The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu
proposed a division of power within the government between
the legislative, the executive and the judiciary. This model of
government was put into force in the USA, after the thirteen
colonies declared their independence from Britain. The American
constitution and its guarantee of individual rights was an important
example for political thinkers in France.
The ideas of these philosophers were discussed intensively in salons
and coffee-houses and spread among people through books and
newspapers. These were frequently read aloud in groups for the
benefit of those who could not read and write. The news that
Louis XVI planned to impose further taxes to be able to meet the
expenses of the state generated anger and protest against the system
of privileges.

Louis XVI had to increase taxes for reasons you have learnt in the
previous section. How do you think he could have gone about doing
this? In France of the Old Regime the monarch did not have the
power to impose taxes according to his will alone. Rather he had to
call a meeting of the Estates General which would then pass his
proposals for new taxes. The Estates General was a political body to
which the three estates sent their representatives. However, the
monarch alone could decide when to call a meeting of this body. The
last time it was done was in 1614.
On 5 May 1789, Louis XVI called together an assembly of the Estates
General to pass proposals for new taxes. A resplendent hall in
Versailles was prepared to host the delegates. The first and second
estates sent 300 representatives each, who were seated in rows facing
each other on two sides, while the 600 members of the third estate
had to stand at the back. The third estate was represented by its more
prosperous and educated members. Peasants, artisans and women
were denied entry to the assembly. However, their grievances and
demands were listed in some 40,000 letters which the representatives
had brought with them.
Voting in the Estates General in the past had been conducted according
to the principle that each estate had one vote. This time too Louis
XVI was determined to continue the same practice. But members of
the third estate demanded that voting now be conducted by the
assembly as a whole, where each member would have one vote. This
was one of the democratic principles put forward by philosophers
like Rousseau in his book The Social Contract. When the king rejected
this proposal, members of the third estate walked out of the assembly
in protest.
The representatives of the third estate viewed themselves as spokesmen
for the whole French nation. On 20 June they assembled in the hall
of an indoor tennis court in the grounds of Versailles. They declared
themselves a National Assembly and swore not to disperse till they
had drafted a constitution for France that would limit the powers of
the monarch. They were led by Mirabeau and Abbé Sieyès. Mirabeau
was born in a noble family but was convinced of the need to do away
with a society of feudal privilege. He brought out a journal and
delivered powerful speeches to the crowds assembled at Versailles.

Abbé Sieyès, originally a priest, wrote an influential pamphlet called
‘What is the Third Estate’?
While the National Assembly was busy at Versailles drafting a
constitution, the rest of France seethed with turmoil. A severe winter
had meant a bad harvest; the price of bread rose, often bakers exploited
the situation and hoarded supplies. After spending hours in long
queues at the bakery, crowds of angry women stormed into the
shops. At the same time, the king ordered troops to move into Paris.
On 14 July, the agitated crowd stormed and destroyed the Bastille.
In the countryside rumours spread from village to village that the
lords of the manor had hired bands of brigands who were on their
way to destroy the ripe crops. Caught in a frenzy of fear, peasants in
several districts seized hoes and pitchforks and attacked chateaux.
They looted hoarded grain and burnt down documents containing
records of manorial dues. A large number of nobles fled from their
homes, many of them migrating to neighbouring countries.
Faced with the power of his revolting subjects, Louis XVI finally
accorded recognition to the National Assembly and accepted the
principle that his powers would from now on be checked by a
constitution. On the night of 4 August 1789, the Assembly passed a
decree abolishing the feudal system of obligations and taxes. Members
of the clergy too were forced to give up their privileges. Tithes were
abolished and lands owned by the Church were confiscated. As a
result, the government acquired assets worth at least 2 billion livres.

2.1 France Becomes a Constitutional Monarchy
The National Assembly completed the draft of the constitution in
1791. Its main object was to limit the powers of the monarch. These
powers instead of being concentrated in the hands of one person,
were now separated and assigned to different institutions – the
legislature, executive and judiciary. This made France a constitutional
monarchy. Fig. 7 explains how the new political system worked.
The Constitution of 1791 vested the power to make laws in the
National Assembly, which was indirectly elected. That is, citizens
voted for a group of electors, who in turn chose the Assembly. Not
all citizens, however, had the right to vote. Only men above 25 years
of age who paid taxes equal to at least 3 days of a labourer’s wage
were given the status of active citizens, that is, they were entitled to
vote. The remaining men and all women were classed as passive
citizens. To qualify as an elector and then as a member of the Assembly,
a man had to belong to the highest bracket of taxpayers.

The Constitution began with a Declaration of the Rights of Man
and Citizen. Rights such as the right to life, freedom of speech,
freedom of opinion, equality before law, were established as ‘natural
and inalienable’ rights, that is, they belonged to each human being
by birth and could not be taken away. It was the duty of the state to
protect each citizen’s natural rights.
The revolutionary journalist Jean-Paul
Marat commented in his newspaper
L’Ami du peuple (The friend of the
people) on the Constitution drafted by
the National Assembly:
‘The task of representing the people
has been given to the rich … the lot of
the poor and oppressed will never be
improved by peaceful means alone. Here
we have absolute proof of how wealth
influences the law. Yet laws will last only as long as the people
agree to obey them. And when they have managed to cast off
the yoke of the aristocrats, they will do the same to the other
owners of wealth.’

The Declaration of Rights of Man and
Citizen
1. Men are born and remain free and equal
in rights.
2. The aim of every political association is
the preservation of the natural and
inalienable rights of man; these are liberty,
property, security and resistance to
oppression.
3. The source of all sovereignty resides in
the nation; no group or individual may
exercise authority that does not come
from the people.
4. Liberty consists of the power to do
whatever is not injurious to others.
5. The law has the right to forbid only
actions that are injurious to society.
6. Law is the expression of the general
will. All citizens have the right to participate
in its formation, personally or through their
representatives. All citizens are equal
before it.
7. No man may be accused, arrested or
detained, except in cases determined by
the law.
11. Every citizen may speak, write and print
freely; he must take responsibility for the
abuse of such liberty in cases determined
by the law.
12. For the maintenance of the public
force 
and 
for 
the 
expenses 
of
administration a common tax is
indispensable; it must be assessed equally
on all citizens in proportion to their means.
17. Since property is a sacred and inviolable
right, no one may be deprived of it, unless
a legally established public necessity
requires it. In that case a just
compensation must be given in advance.

Reading political symbols
The majority of men and women in the eighteenth century could not read or write. So images and symbols
were frequently used instead of printed words to communicate important ideas. The painting by Le Barbier
(Fig. 8) uses many such symbols to convey the content of the Declaration of Rights. Let us try to read
these symbols.
Snake biting its tail to form a ring: Symbol of
Eternity. A ring has neither beginning nor end.
Sceptre: Symbol of royal power.
The eye within a triangle radiating light: The all-
seeing eye stands for knowledge. The rays of the sun
will drive away the clouds of ignorance.
The bundle of rods or fasces: One rod
can be easily broken, but not an entire
bundle. Strength lies in unity.
The broken chain: Chains were used to fetter slaves.
A broken chain stands for the act of becoming free.

The situation in France continued to be tense during the following years.
Although Louis XVI had signed the Constitution, he entered into secret
negotiations with the King of Prussia. Rulers of other neighbouring
countries too were worried by the developments in France and made
plans to send troops to put down the events that had been taking place
there since the summer of 1789. Before this could happen, the National
Assembly voted in April 1792 to declare war against Prussia and Austria.
Thousands of volunteers thronged from the provinces to join the army.
They saw this as a war of the people against kings and aristocracies all
over Europe. Among the patriotic songs they sang was the Marseillaise,
composed by the poet Roget de L’Isle. It was sung for the first time by
volunteers from Marseilles as they marched into Paris and so got its
name. The Marseillaise is now the national anthem of France.
The revolutionary wars brought losses and economic difficulties
to the people. While the men were away fighting at the front,
women were left to cope with the tasks of earning a living and
looking after their families. Large sections of the population were
convinced that the revolution had to be carried further, as the
Constitution of 1791 gave political rights only to the richer sections
of society. Political clubs became an important rallying point for
people who wished to discuss government policies and plan their
own forms of action. The most successful of these clubs was that of
the Jacobins, which got its name from the former convent of St
Jacob in Paris. Women too, who had been active throughout this
period, formed their own clubs. Section 4 of this chapter will tell
you more about their activities and demands.
The members of the Jacobin club belonged mainly to the less
prosperous sections of society. They included small shopkeepers,
artisans such as shoemakers, pastry cooks, watch-makers, printers,
as well as servants and daily-wage workers. Their leader was
Maximilian Robespierre. A large group among the Jacobins decided
to start wearing long striped trousers similar to those worn by
dock workers. This was to set themselves apart from the fashionable
sections of society, especially nobles, who wore knee breeches. It

This is one of the rare paintings by a woman artist.
The revolutionary events made it possible for
women to train with established painters and to
exhibit their works in the Salon, which was an
exhibition held every two years.

is, the female form symbolises the idea of freedom.

was a way of proclaiming the end of the power wielded by the
wearers of knee breeches. These Jacobins came to be known as the
sans-culottes, literally meaning ‘those without knee breeches’. Sans-
culottes men wore in addition the red cap that symbolised liberty.
Women however were not allowed to do so.
In the summer of 1792 the Jacobins planned an insurrection of a
large number of Parisians who were angered by the short supplies
and high prices of food. On the morning of August 10 they stormed
the Palace of the Tuileries, massacred the king’s guards and held
the king himself as hostage for several hours. Later the Assembly
voted to imprison the royal family. Elections were held. From now
on all men of 21 years and above, regardless of wealth, got the right
to vote.
The newly elected assembly was called the Convention. On
21 September 1792 it abolished the monarchy and declared France
a republic. As you know, a republic is a form of government where

What is liberty? Two conflicting views:
The revolutionary journalist Camille
Desmoulins wrote the following in 1793. He
was executed shortly after, during the Reign
of Terror.
‘Some people believe that Liberty is like a
child, which needs to go through a phase of
being disciplined before it attains maturity.
Quite the opposite. Liberty is Happiness,
Reason, Equality, Justice, it is the Declaration
of Rights … You would like to finish off all
your enemies by guillotining them. Has
anyone heard of something more senseless?
Would it be possible to bring a single person
to the scaffold without making ten more
enemies among his relations and friends?’
On 7 February 1794,
Robespierre made a
speech 
at 
the
Convention, which was
then carried by the
newspaper Le Moniteur
Universel. Here is an
extract from it:
‘To establish and consolidate democracy, to
achieve the peaceful rule of constitutional
laws, we must first finish the war of liberty
against tyranny …. We must annihilate the
enemies of the republic at home and abroad,
or else we shall perish. In time of Revolution
a democratic government may rely on terror.
Terror is nothing but justice, swift, severe
and inflexible; … and is used to meet the
most urgent needs of the fatherland. To curb
the enemies of Liberty through terror is the
right of the founder of the Republic.’

Louis XVI was sentenced to death by a court on the charge of
treason. On 21 January 1793 he was executed publicly at the
Place de la Concorde. The queen Marie Antoinette met with the
same fate shortly after.
3.1 The Reign of Terror
The period from 1793 to 1794 is referred to as the Reign of
Terror. Robespierre followed a policy of severe control and
punishment. All those whom he saw as being ‘enemies’ of the
republic – ex-nobles and clergy, members of other political
parties, even members of his own party who did not agree with
his methods – were arrested, imprisoned and then tried by a
revolutionary tribunal. If the court found them ‘guilty’ they
were guillotined. The guillotine is a device consisting of two
poles and a blade with which a person is beheaded. It was named
after Dr Guillotin who invented it.
Robespierre’s government issued laws placing a maximum ceiling
on wages and prices. Meat and bread were rationed. Peasants
were forced to transport their grain to the cities and sell it at
prices fixed by the government. The use of more expensive white
flour was forbidden; all citizens were required to eat the pain
d’égalité (equality bread), a loaf made of wholewheat. Equality
was also sought to be practised through forms of speech and
address. Instead of the traditional Monsieur (Sir) and Madame
(Madam) all French men and women were henceforth Citoyen
and Citoyenne (Citizen). Churches were shut down and their
buildings converted into barracks or offices.
Robespierre pursued his policies so relentlessly that even his
supporters began to demand moderation. Finally, he was
convicted by a court in July 1794, arrested and on the next day
sent to the guillotine.

impression of a revolutionary festival does this image convey?
3.2 A Directory Rules France
The fall of the Jacobin government allowed the wealthier middle
classes to seize power. A new constitution was introduced which
denied the vote to non-propertied sections of society. It provided
for two elected legislative councils. These then appointed a Directory,
an executive made up of five members. This was meant as a safeguard
against the concentration of power in a one-man executive as under
the Jacobins. However, the Directors often clashed with the legislative
councils, who then sought to dismiss them. The political instability
of the Directory paved the way for the rise of a military dictator,
Napoleon Bonaparte.
Through all these changes in the form of government, the ideals of
freedom, of equality before the law and of fraternity remained inspiring
ideals that motivated political movements in France and the rest of Europe
during the following century.

main demands was that women enjoy the same political rights as
men. Women were disappointed that the Constitution of 1791 reduced
them to passive citizens. They demanded the right to vote, to be
elected to the Assembly and to hold political office. Only then, they
felt, would their interests be represented in the new government.
In the early years, the revolutionary government did introduce laws
that helped improve the lives of women. Together with the creation
of state schools, schooling was made compulsory for all girls. Their
fathers could no longer force them into marriage against their will.
Marriage was made into a contract entered into freely and registered
under civil law. Divorce was made legal, and could be applied for by
both women and men. Women could now train for jobs, could
become artists or run small businesses.
Women’s struggle for equal political rights, however, continued.
During the Reign of Terror, the new government issued laws ordering
closure of women’s clubs and banning their political activities. Many
prominent women were arrested and a number of them executed.
Women’s movements for voting rights and equal wages continued
through the next two hundred years in many countries of the world.
The fight for the vote was carried out through an international
suffrage movement during the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. The example of the political activities of French women
during the revolutionary years was kept alive as an inspiring memory.
It was finally in 1946 that women in France won the right to vote.
The life of a revolutionary woman – Olympe de Gouges

Olympe de Gouges was one of the most important of the politically
active women in revolutionary France. She protested against the
Constitution and the Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen as
they excluded women from basic rights that each human being was
entitled to. So, in 1791, she wrote a Declaration of the Rights of
Woman and Citizen, which she addressed to the Queen and to the
members of the National Assembly, demanding that they act upon
it. In 1793, Olympe de Gouges criticised the Jacobin government
for forcibly closing down women’s clubs. She was tried by the
National Convention, which charged her with treason. Soon after
this she was executed.

Some of the basic rights set forth in Olympe de Gouges’
Declaration.
1. Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights.
2. The goal of all political associations is the preservation of the natural
rights of woman and man: These rights are liberty, property, security,
and above all resistance to oppression.
3. The source of all sovereignty resides in the nation, which is nothing
but the union of woman and man.
4. The law should be the expression of the general will; all female and
male citizens should have a say either personally or by their
representatives in its formulation; it should be the same for all. All
female and male citizens are equally entitled to all honours
and public employment according to their abilities and without any
other distinction than that of their talents.
5. No woman is an exception; she is accused, arrested, and detained in
cases determined by law. Women, like men, obey this rigorous law.

Gouges (Source F) with the Declaration of the

In 1793, the Jacobin politician Chaumette
sought to justify the closure of women’s
clubs on the following grounds:
‘Has Nature entrusted domestic duties to
men? Has she given us breasts to nurture
babies?
No.
She said to Man:
Be a man. Hunting, agriculture, political duties
… that is your kingdom.
She said to Woman:
Be a woman … the things of the household,
the sweet duties of motherhood – those
are your tasks.
Shameless are those women, who wish to
become men. Have not duties been fairly
distributed?’

 The Abolition of Slavery
One of the most revolutionary social reforms of the Jacobin regime
was the abolition of slavery in the French colonies. The colonies in
the Caribbean – Martinique, Guadeloupe and San Domingo – were
important suppliers of commodities such as tobacco, indigo, sugar
and coffee. But the reluctance of Europeans to go and work in distant
and unfamiliar lands meant a shortage of labour on the plantations.
So this was met by a triangular slave trade between Europe, Africa
and the Americas. The slave trade began in the seventeenth century.
French merchants sailed from the ports of Bordeaux or Nantes to
the African coast, where they bought slaves from local chieftains.
Branded and shackled, the slaves were packed tightly into ships for
the three-month long voyage across the Atlantic to the Caribbean.
There they were sold to plantation owners. The exploitation of slave
labour made it possible to meet the growing demand in European
markets for sugar, coffee, and indigo. Port cities like Bordeaux and
Nantes owed their economic prosperity to the flourishing slave trade.
Throughout the eighteenth century there was little criticism of slavery
in France. The National Assembly held long debates about whether
the rights of man should be extended to all French subjects including
those in the colonies. But it did not pass any laws, fearing opposition
from businessmen whose incomes depended on the slave trade. It
was finally the Convention which in 1794 legislated to free all slaves
in the French overseas possessions. This, however, turned out to be
a short-term measure: ten years later, Napoleon reintroduced slavery.
Plantation owners understood their freedom as including the right
to enslave African Negroes in pursuit of their economic interests.
Slavery was finally abolished in French colonies in 1848.

The Revolution and Everyday Life
Can politics change the clothes people wear, the language they speak
or the books they read? The years following 1789 in France saw many
such changes in the lives of men, women and children. The
revolutionary governments took it upon themselves to pass laws that
would translate the ideals of liberty and equality into everyday practice.
One important law that came into effect soon after the storming of
the Bastille in the summer of 1789 was the abolition of censorship. In
the Old Regime all written material and cultural activities – books,
newspapers, plays – could be published or performed only after they
had been approved by the censors of the king. Now the Declaration
of the Rights of Man and Citizen proclaimed freedom of speech and
expression to be a natural right. Newspapers, pamphlets, books and
printed pictures flooded the towns of France from where they
travelled rapidly into the countryside. They all described and discussed
the events and changes taking place in France. Freedom of the press
also meant that opposing views of events could be expressed. Each
side sought to convince the others of its position through the medium
of print. Plays, songs and festive processions attracted large numbers
of people. This was one way they could grasp and identify with ideas
such as liberty or justice that political philosophers wrote about at
length in texts which only a handful of educated people could read.

Conclusion
In 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte crowned himself Emperor of France.
He set out to conquer neighbouring European countries, dispossessing
dynasties and creating kingdoms where he placed members of his family.
Napoleon saw his role as a moderniser of Europe. He introduced many
laws such as the protection of private property and a uniform system of
weights and measures provided by the decimal system. Initially, many
saw Napoleon as a liberator who would bring freedom for the people.
But soon the Napoleonic armies came to be viewed everywhere as an
invading force. He was finally defeated at Waterloo in 1815. Many of his
measures that carried the revolutionary ideas of liberty and modern laws
to other parts of Europe had an impact on people long after Napoleon
had left.
The ideas of liberty and democratic rights were the most important
legacy of the French Revolution. These spread from France to the
rest of Europe during the nineteenth century, where feudal systems

1 The Age of Social Change
In the previous chapter you read about the powerful ideas of freedom
and equality that circulated in Europe after the French Revolution.
The French Revolution opened up the possibility of creating a
dramatic change in the way in which society was structured. As you
have read, before the eighteenth century society was broadly divided
into estates and orders and it was the aristocracy and church which
controlled economic and social power. Suddenly, after the revolution,
it seemed possible to change this. In many parts of the world including
Europe and Asia, new ideas about individual rights and who
controlled social power began to be discussed. In India, Raja
Rammohan Roy and Derozio talked of the significance of the French
Revolution, and many others debated the ideas of post-revolutionary
Europe. The developments in the colonies, in turn, reshaped these
ideas of societal change.
Not everyone in Europe, however, wanted a complete transformation
of society. Responses varied from those who accepted that some
change was necessary but wished for a gradual shift, to those who
wanted to restructure society radically. Some were ‘conservatives’,
others were ‘liberals’ or ‘radicals’. What did these terms really mean
in the context of the time? What separated these strands of politics
and what linked them together? We must remember that these terms
do not mean the same thing in all contexts or at all times.
We will look briefly at some of the important political traditions of
the nineteenth century, and see how they influenced change. Then
we will focus on one historical event in which there was an attempt
at a radical transformation of society. Through the revolution in
Russia, socialism became one of the most significant and powerful
ideas to shape society in the twentieth century.
1.1 Liberals, Radicals and Conservatives
One of the groups which looked to change society were the liberals.
Liberals wanted a nation which tolerated all religions. We should
remember that at this time European states usually discriminated in

favour of one religion or another (Britain favoured the Church of
England, Austria and Spain favoured the Catholic Church). Liberals
also opposed the uncontrolled power of dynastic rulers. They wanted
to safeguard the rights of individuals against governments. They
argued for a representative, elected parliamentary government, subject
to laws interpreted by a well-trained judiciary that was independent
of rulers and officials. However, they were not ‘democrats’. They
did not believe in universal adult franchise, that is, the right of every
citizen to vote. They felt men of property mainly should have the
vote. They also did not want the vote for women.
In contrast, radicals wanted a nation in which government was based
on the majority of a country’s population. Many supported women’s
suffragette movements. Unlike liberals, they opposed the privileges
of great landowners and wealthy factory owners. They were not
against the existence of private property but disliked concentration
of property in the hands of a few.
Conservatives were opposed to radicals and liberals. After the French
Revolution, however, even conservatives had opened their minds to
the need for change. Earlier, in the eighteenth century, conservatives
had been generally opposed to the idea of change. By the nineteenth
century, they accepted that some change was inevitable but believed
that the past had to be respected and change had to be brought about
through a slow process.
Such differing ideas about societal change clashed during the social
and political turmoil that followed the French Revolution. The
various attempts at revolution and national transformation in the
nineteenth century helped define both the limits and potential of
these political tendencies.
1.2 Industrial Society and Social Change
These political trends were signs of a new time. It was a time of
profound social and economic changes. It was a time when new cities
came up and new industrialised regions developed, railways expanded
and the Industrial Revolution occurred.
Industrialisation brought men, women and children to factories. Work
hours were often long and wages were poor. Unemployment was
common, particularly during times of low demand for industrial goods.
Housing and sanitation were problems since towns were growing
rapidly. Liberals and radicals searched for solutions to these issues.

Almost all industries were the property of individuals. Liberals and
radicals themselves were often property owners and employers.
Having made their wealth through trade or industrial ventures, they
felt that such effort should be encouraged – that its benefits would
be achieved if the workforce in the economy was healthy and citizens
were educated. Opposed to the privileges the old aristocracy had by
birth, they firmly believed in the value of individual effort, labour
and enterprise. If freedom of individuals was ensured, if the poor
could labour, and those with capital could operate without restraint,
they believed that societies would develop. Many working men and
women who wanted changes in the world rallied around liberal and
radical groups and parties in the early nineteenth century.
Some nationalists, liberals and radicals wanted revolutions to put an
end to the kind of governments established in Europe in 1815. In
France, Italy, Germany and Russia, they became revolutionaries and
worked to overthrow existing monarchs. Nationalists talked of
revolutions that would create ‘nations’ where all citizens would have

equal rights. After 1815, Giuseppe Mazzini, an Italian nationalist, conspired
with others to achieve this in Italy. Nationalists elsewhere – including India
– read his writings.
1.3 The Coming of Socialism to Europe
Perhaps one of the most far-reaching visions of how society should be
structured was socialism. By the mid - nineteenth century in Europe, socialism
was a well-known body of ideas that attracted widespread attention.
Socialists were against private property, and saw it as the root of all social ills
of the time. Why? Individuals owned the property that gave employment
but the propertied were concerned only with personal gain and not with
the welfare of those who made the property productive. So if society as a
whole rather than single individuals controlled property, more attention
would be paid to collective social interests. Socialists wanted this change and
campaigned for it.
How could a society without property operate? What would be the basis of
socialist society?
Socialists had different visions of the future. Some believed in the idea of
cooperatives. Robert Owen (1771-1858), a leading English manufacturer,
sought to build a cooperative community called New Harmony in Indiana
(USA). Other socialists felt that cooperatives could not be built on a wide
scale only through individual initiative: they demanded that governments
encourage cooperatives. In France, for instance, Louis Blanc (1813-1882)
wanted the government to encourage cooperatives and replace capitalist
enterprises. These cooperatives were to be associations of people who
produced goods together and divided the profits according to the work
done by members.
Karl Marx (1818-1883) and Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) added other ideas
to this body of arguments. Marx argued that industrial society was ‘capitalist’.
Capitalists owned the capital invested in factories, and the profit of capitalists
was produced by workers. The conditions of workers could not improve
as long as this profit was accumulated by private capitalists. Workers had to
overthrow capitalism and the rule of private property. Marx believed that
to free themselves from capitalist exploitation, workers had to construct a
radically socialist society where all property was socially controlled. This
would be a communist society. He was convinced that workers would
triumph in their conflict with capitalists. A communist society was the natural
society of the future.

and socialist ideas of private property.

1.4 Support for Socialism
By the 1870s, socialist ideas spread through Europe. To coordinate
their efforts, socialists formed an international body – namely, the
Second International.
Workers in England and Germany began forming associations to
fight for better living and working conditions. They set up funds to
help members in times of distress and demanded a reduction of working
hours and the right to vote. In Germany, these associations worked closely
with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and helped it win parliamentary
seats. By 1905, socialists and trade unionists formed a Labour Party in
Britain and a Socialist Party in France. However, till 1914, socialists never
succeeded in forming a government in Europe. Represented by strong
figures in parliamentary politics, their ideas did shape legislation, but
governments continued to be run by conservatives, liberals and radicals.

popular uprising in Paris between March and May 1871. This was a period when the town council (commune) of Paris was
taken over by a ‘peoples’ government’ consisting of workers, ordinary people, professionals, political activists and others.
The uprising emerged against a background of growing discontent against the policies of the French state. The ‘Paris
Commune’ was ultimately crushed by government troops but it was celebrated by Socialists the world over as a prelude to a
socialist revolution.The Paris Commune is also popularly remembered for two important legacies: one, for its association with
the workers’ red flag – that was the flag adopted by the communards ( revolutionaries) in Paris; two, for the ‘Marseillaise’,
originally written as a war song in 1792, it became a symbol of the Commune and of the struggle for liberty.

2 The Russian Revolution
In one of the least industrialised of European states this situation was
reversed. Socialists took over the government in Russia through the
October Revolution of 1917. The fall of monarchy in February 1917
and the events of October are normally called the Russian Revolution.
How did this come about? What were the social and political
conditions in Russia when the revolution occurred? To answer these
questions, let us look at Russia a few years before the revolution.
2.1 The Russian Empire in 1914
In 1914, Tsar Nicholas II ruled Russia and its empire. Besides the
territory around Moscow, the Russian empire included current-day
Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, parts of Poland, Ukraine and
Belarus. It stretched to the Pacific and comprised today’s Central
Asian states, as well as Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The majority
religion was Russian Orthodox Christianity – which had grown out
of the Greek Orthodox Church – but the empire also included
Catholics, Protestants, Muslims and Buddhists.

2.2 Economy and Society
At the beginning of the twentieth century, the vast majority of
Russia’s people were agriculturists. About 85 per cent of the Russian
empire’s population earned their living from agriculture. This
proportion was higher than in most European countries. For instance,
in France and Germany the proportion was between 40 per cent and
50 per cent. In the empire, cultivators produced for the market as
well as for their own needs and Russia was a major exporter of grain.
Industry was found in pockets. Prominent industrial areas were
St Petersburg and Moscow. Craftsmen undertook much of the
production, but large factories existed alongside craft workshops.
Many factories were set up in the 1890s, when Russia’s railway
network was extended, and foreign investment in industry increased.
Coal production doubled and iron and steel output quadrupled. By
the 1900s, in some areas factory workers and craftsmen were almost
equal in number.
Most industry was the private property of industrialists. Government
supervised large factories to ensure minimum wages and limited hours
of work. But factory inspectors could not prevent rules being broken.
In craft units and small workshops, the working day was sometimes
15 hours, compared with 10 or 12 hours in factories. Accommodation
varied from rooms to dormitories.
Workers were a divided social group. Some had strong links with
the villages from which they came. Others had settled in cities
permanently. Workers were divided by skill. A metalworker of St.
Petersburg recalled, ‘Metalworkers considered themselves aristocrats
among other workers. Their occupations demanded more training
and skill . . . ’ Women made up 31 per cent of the factory labour
force by 1914, but they were paid less than men (between half and
three-quarters of a man’s wage). Divisions among workers showed
themselves in dress and manners too. Some workers formed
associations to help members in times of unemployment or financial
hardship but such associations were few.
Despite divisions, workers did unite to strike work (stop work) when
they disagreed with employers about dismissals or work conditions.
These strikes took place frequently in the textile industry during
1896-1897, and in the metal industry during 1902.
In the countryside, peasants cultivated most of the land. But the
nobility, the crown and the Orthodox Church owned large
properties. Like workers, peasants too were divided. They were also

parliament. Liberals in Russia campaigned to end this state of affairs.
Together with the Social Democrats and Socialist Revolutionaries,
they worked with peasants and workers during the revolution of
1905 to demand a constitution. They were supported in the empire
by nationalists (in Poland for instance) and in Muslim-dominated
areas by jadidists who wanted modernised Islam to lead their societies.
The year 1904 was a particularly bad one for Russian workers. Prices
of essential goods rose so quickly that real wages declined by 20 per
cent. The membership of workers’ associations rose dramatically.
When four members of the Assembly of Russian Workers, which
had been formed in 1904, were dismissed at the Putilov Iron Works,
there was a call for industrial action. Over the next few days over
110,000 workers in St Petersburg went on strike demanding a
reduction in the working day to eight hours, an increase in wages
and improvement in working conditions.
When the procession of workers led by Father Gapon reached the
Winter Palace it was attacked by the police and the Cossacks. Over
100 workers were killed and about 300 wounded. The incident,
known as Bloody Sunday, started a series of events that became known
as the 1905 Revolution. Strikes took place all over the country and
universities closed down when student bodies staged walkouts,
complaining about the lack of civil liberties. Lawyers, doctors,
engineers and other middle-class workers established the Union of
Unions and demanded a constituent assembly.
During the 1905 Revolution, the Tsar allowed the creation of an
elected consultative Parliament or Duma. For a brief while during
the revolution, there existed a large number of trade unions and
factory committees made up of factory workers. After 1905, most
committees and unions worked unofficially, since they were declared
illegal. Severe restrictions were placed on political activity. The Tsar
dismissed the first Duma within 75 days and the re-elected second
Duma within three months. He did not want any questioning of his
authority or any reduction in his power. He changed the voting
laws and packed the third Duma with conservative politicians. Liberals
and revolutionaries were kept out.
2.5 The First World War and the Russian Empire
In 1914, war broke out between two European alliances – Germany,
Austria and Turkey (the Central powers) and France, Britain and
Russia (later Italy and Romania). Each country had a global empire

Fig.7 – Russian soldiers during the First
World War.
The Imperial Russian army came to be known
as the ‘Russian steam roller’. It was the
largest armed force in the world. When this
army shifted its loyalty and began supporting
the revolutionaries, Tsarist power collapsed.
and the war was fought outside Europe as well as
in Europe. This was the First World War.
In Russia, the war was initially popular and people
rallied around Tsar Nicholas II. As the war
continued, though, the Tsar refused to consult the
main parties in the Duma. Support wore thin. Anti-
German sentiments ran high, as can be seen in the
renaming of St Petersburg – a German name – as
Petrograd. The Tsarina Alexandra’s German
origins and poor advisers, especially a monk called
Rasputin, made the autocracy unpopular.
The First World War on the ‘eastern front’ differed
from that on the ‘western front’. In the west, armies
fought from trenches stretched along eastern
France. In the east, armies moved a good deal and
fought battles leaving large casualties. Defeats were
shocking and demoralising. Russia’s armies lost
badly in Germany and Austria between 1914 and
1916. There were over 7 million casualties by 1917.
As they retreated, the Russian army destroyed
crops and buildings to prevent the enemy from
being able to live off the land. The destruction of
crops and buildings led to over 3 million refugees in Russia. The
situation discredited the government and the Tsar. Soldiers did not
wish to fight such a war.
The war also had a severe impact on industry. Russia’s own industries
were few in number and the country was cut off from other suppliers
of industrial goods by German control of the Baltic Sea. Industrial
equipment disintegrated more rapidly in Russia than elsewhere in
Europe. By 1916, railway lines began to break down. Able-bodied
men were called up to the war. As a result, there were labour shortages
and small workshops producing essentials were shut down. Large
supplies of grain were sent to feed the army. For the people in the
cities, bread and flour became scarce. By the winter of 1916, riots at
bread shops were common.

In the winter of 1917, conditions in the capital, Petrograd, were grim.
The layout of the city seemed to emphasise the divisions among its
people. The workers’ quarters and factories were located on the right
bank of the River Neva. On the left bank were the fashionable areas,
the Winter Palace, and official buildings, including the palace where
the Duma met. In February 1917, food shortages were deeply felt in
the workers’ quarters. The winter was very cold – there had been
exceptional frost and heavy snow. Parliamentarians wishing to
preserve elected government, were opposed to the Tsar’s desire to dissolve
the Duma.
On 22 February, a lockout took place at a
factory on the right bank. The next day, workers
in fifty factories called a strike in sympathy.
In many factories, women led the way to strikes.
This came to be called the International Women’s
Day. Demonstrating workers crossed from the
factory quarters to the centre of the capital – the
Nevskii Prospekt. At this stage, no political party
was actively organising the movement. As the
fashionable quarters and official buildings were
surrounded by workers, the government imposed
a curfew. Demonstrators dispersed by the evening,
but they came back on the 24th and 25th. The
government called out the cavalry and police to
keep an eye on them.
On Sunday, 25 February, the government
suspended the Duma. Politicians spoke out against
the measure. Demonstrators returned in force to
the streets of the left bank on the 26th. On the
27th, the Police Headquarters were ransacked. The
streets thronged with people raising slogans about
bread, wages, better hours and democracy. The
government tried to control the situation and
called out the cavalry once again. However, the
cavalry refused to fire on the demonstrators. An
officer was shot at the barracks of a regiment and
three other regiments mutinied, voting to join the
striking workers. By that evening, soldiers and

socialist revolution and the Provisional Government needed to be
supported. But the developments of the subsequent months changed
their attitude.
Through the summer the workers’ movement spread. In industrial
areas, factory committees were formed which began questioning
the way industrialists ran their factories. Trade unions grew in
number. Soldiers’ committees were formed in the army. In June,
about 500 Soviets sent representatives to an All Russian Congress
of Soviets. As the Provisional Government saw its power reduce
and Bolshevik influence grow, it decided to take stern measures
against the spreading discontent. It resisted attempts by workers
to run factories and began arresting leaders. Popular
demonstrations staged by the Bolsheviks in July 1917 were sternly
repressed. Many Bolshevik leaders had to go into hiding or flee.
Meanwhile in the countryside, peasants and their Socialist
Revolutionary leaders pressed for a redistribution of land. Land
committees were formed to handle this. Encouraged by the
Socialist Revolutionaries, peasants seized land between July and
September 1917.

4 What Changed after October?
The Bolsheviks were totally opposed to private property. Most
industry and banks were nationalised in November 1917. This meant
that the government took over ownership and management. Land
was declared social property and peasants were allowed to seize the
land of the nobility. In cities, Bolsheviks enforced the partition of
large houses according to family requirements. They banned the
use of the old titles of aristocracy. To assert the change, new
uniforms were designed for the army and officials, following a
clothing competition organised in 1918 – when the Soviet hat
(budeonovka) was chosen.
The Bolshevik Party was renamed the Russian Communist Party
(Bolshevik). In November 1917, the Bolsheviks conducted the
elections to the Constituent Assembly, but they failed to gain
majority support. In January 1918, the Assembly rejected Bolshevik
measures and Lenin dismissed the Assembly. He thought the All
Russian Congress of Soviets was more democratic than an assembly
elected in uncertain conditions. In March 1918, despite opposition
by their political allies, the Bolsheviks made peace with Germany
at Brest Litovsk. In the years that
followed, the Bolsheviks became
the only party to participate in the
elections to the All Russian
Congress of Soviets, which became
the Parliament of the country.
Russia became a one-party state.
Trade unions were kept under
party control. The secret police
(called the Cheka first, and later
OGPU and NKVD) punished
those 
who 
criticised 
the
Bolsheviks. Many young writers
and artists rallied to the Party
because it stood for socialism and
for change. After October 1917,
this led to experiments in the arts
and architecture. But many became
disillusioned because of the
censorship the Party encouraged.

The October Revolution and the Russian Countryside: Two Views
‘News of the revolutionary uprising of October 25, 1917, reached the village the following day and
was greeted with enthusiasm; to the peasants it meant free land and an end to the war. ...The day
the news arrived, the landowner’s manor house was looted, his stock farms were “requisitioned”
and his vast orchard was cut down and sold to the peasants for wood; all his far buildings were
torn down and left in ruins while the land was distributed among the peasants who were prepared
to live the new Soviet life’.
From: Fedor Belov, The History of a Soviet Collective Farm
A member of a landowning family wrote to a relative about what happened at the estate:
‘The “coup” happened quite painlessly, quietly and peacefully. …The first days were unbearable..
Mikhail Mikhailovich [the estate owner] was calm...The girls also…I must say the chairman
behaves correctly and even politely. We were left two cows and two horses. The servants tell them
all the time not to bother us. “Let them live. We vouch for their safety and property. We want them
treated as humanely as possible….”
…There are rumours that several villages are trying to evict the committees and return the estate
to Mikhail Mikhailovich. I don’t know if this will happen, or if it’s good for us. But we rejoice that
there is a conscience in our people...’
 From: Serge Schmemann, Echoes of a Native Land. Two Centuries of a Russian Village (1997).
4.1 The Civil War
When the Bolsheviks ordered land redistribution, the Russian army
began to break up. Soldiers, mostly peasants, wished to go home for
the redistribution and deserted. Non-Bolshevik socialists, liberals and
supporters of autocracy condemned the Bolshevik uprising. Their
leaders moved to south Russia and organised troops to fight the
Bolsheviks (the ‘reds’). During 1918 and 1919, the ‘greens’ (Socialist
Revolutionaries) and ‘whites’ (pro-Tsarists) controlled most of the
Russian empire. They were backed by French, American, British
and Japanese troops – all those forces who were worried at the growth
of socialism in Russia. As these troops and the Bolsheviks fought a
civil war, looting, banditry and famine became common.
Supporters of private property among ‘whites’ took harsh steps with
peasants who had seized land. Such actions led to the loss of popular
support for the non-Bolsheviks. By January 1920, the Bolsheviks
controlled most of the former Russian empire. They succeeded due

to cooperation with non-Russian nationalities and Muslim jadidists.
Cooperation did not work where Russian colonists themselves turned
Bolshevik. In Khiva, in Central Asia, Bolshevik colonists brutally
massacred local nationalists in the name of defending socialism. In
this situation, many were confused about what the Bolshevik
government represented.
Partly to remedy this, most non-Russian nationalities were given
political autonomy in the Soviet Union (USSR) – the state the
Bolsheviks created from the Russian empire in December 1922. But
since this was combined with unpopular policies that the Bolsheviks
forced the local government to follow – like the harsh discouragement
of nomadism – attempts to win over different nationalities were
only partly successful.
Central Asia of the October Revolution: Two Views
M.N.Roy was an Indian revolutionary, a founder of the Mexican Communist Party
and prominent Comintern leader in India, China and Europe. He was in Central
Asia at the time of the civil war in the 1920s. He wrote:
‘The chieftain was a benevolent old man; his attendant … a youth who … spoke
Russian … He had heard of the Revolution, which had overthrown the Tsar and
driven away the Generals who conquered the homeland of the Kirgiz. So, the
Revolution meant that the Kirgiz were masters of their home again. “Long Live the
Revolution” shouted the Kirgiz youth who seemed to be a born Bolshevik. The
whole tribe joined.’
M.N.Roy, Memoirs (1964).
‘The Kirghiz welcomed the first revolution (ie February Revolution) with joy and the
second revolution with consternation and terror … [This] first revolution freed them
from the oppression of the Tsarist regime and strengthened their hope that …
autonomy would be realised. The second revolution (October Revolution) was
accompanied by violence, pillage, taxes and the establishment of dictatorial power
… Once a small group of Tsarist bureaucrats oppressed the Kirghiz. Now the same
group of people … perpetuate the same regime ...’
Kazakh leader in 1919, quoted in Alexander Bennigsen and Chantal Quelquejay,
Les Mouvements Nationaux chez les Musulmans de Russie, (1960).

Socialist Cultivation in a Village in the Ukraine

consisted of thirteen families with a total of seventy persons … The farm tools taken
from the … farms were turned over to the commune …The members ate in a communal
dining hall and income was divided in accordance with the principles of “cooperative
communism”. The entire proceeds of the members’ labor, as well as all dwellings and
facilities belonging to the commune were shared by the commune members.’

symbol of socialism.
This poster states: ‘The smoke from the
chimneys is the breathing of Soviet Russia.’
4.2 Making a Socialist Society
During the civil war, the Bolsheviks kept industries and banks
nationalised. They permitted peasants to cultivate the land that had
been socialised. Bolsheviks used confiscated land to demonstrate what
collective work could be.
A process of centralised planning was introduced. Officials assessed
how the economy could work and set targets for a five-year period.
On this basis they made the Five Year Plans. The government fixed
all prices to promote industrial growth during the first two ‘Plans’
(1927-1932 and 1933-1938). Centralised planning led to economic
growth. Industrial production increased (between 1929 and 1933 by
100 per cent in the case of oil, coal and steel). New factory cities
came into being.
However, rapid construction led to poor working conditions. In
the city of Magnitogorsk, the construction of a steel plant was achieved
in three years. Workers lived hard lives and the result was 550
stoppages of work in the first year alone. In living quarters, ‘in the
wintertime, at 40 degrees below, people had to climb down from the
fourth floor and dash across the street in order to go to the toilet’.
An extended schooling system developed, and arrangements were
made for factory workers and peasants to enter universities. Crèches
were established in factories for the children of women workers.
Cheap public health care was provided. Model living quarters were
set up for workers. The effect of all this was uneven, though, since
government resources were limited.

4.3 Stalinism and Collectivisation
The period of the early Planned Economy was linked to
the disasters of the collectivisation of agriculture. By 1927-
1928, the towns in Soviet Russia were facing an acute
problem of grain supplies. The government fixed prices
at which grain must be sold, but the peasants refused to sell their
grain to government buyers at these prices.
Stalin, who headed the party after the death of Lenin, introduced
firm emergency measures. He believed that rich peasants and traders
in the countryside were holding stocks in the hope of higher prices.
Speculation had to be stopped and supplies confiscated.
In 1928, Party members toured the grain-producing areas, supervising
enforced grain collections, and raiding ‘kulaks’ – the name for well-
to-do peasants. As shortages continued, the decision was taken to
collectivise farms. It was argued that grain shortages were partly due
to the small size of holdings. After 1917, land had been given over to
peasants. These small-sized peasant farms could not be modernised.
To develop modern farms, and run them along industrial lines with
machinery, it was necessary to ‘eliminate kulaks’, take away land
from peasants, and establish state-controlled large farms.
What followed was Stalin’s collectivisation programme. From 1929,
the Party forced all peasants to cultivate in collective farms (kolkhoz).
The bulk of land and implements were transferred to the ownership
of collective farms. Peasants worked on the land, and the kolkhoz
profit was shared. Enraged peasants resisted the authorities and
destroyed their livestock. Between 1929 and 1931, the number of
cattle fell by one-third. Those who resisted collectivisation were
severely punished. Many were deported and exiled. As they resisted
collectivisation, peasants argued that they were not rich and they
were not against socialism. They merely did not want to work in
collective farms for a variety of reasons. Stalin’s government allowed
some independent cultivation, but treated such cultivators
unsympathetically.
In spite of collectivisation, production did not increase immediately.
In fact, the bad harvests of 1930-1933 led to one of most devastating
famines in Soviet history when over 4 million died.

states: ‘We shall strike at the kulak working for

work for the spring harvest.
Within a short time, large scale activities from the above-mentioned regions

have taken place near the border.

From: V. Sokolov (ed), Obshchestvo I Vlast, v 1930-ye gody.
Many within the Party criticised the confusion in industrial
production under the Planned Economy and the consequences of
collectivisation. Stalin and his sympathisers charged these critics with
conspiracy against socialism. Accusations were made throughout the
country, and by 1939, over 2 million were in prisons or labour camps.
Most were innocent of the crimes, but no one spoke for them. A
large number were forced to make false confessions under torture
and were executed – several among them were talented professionals.

Existing socialist parties in Europe did not wholly approve of the
way the Bolsheviks took power – and kept it. However, the possibility
of a workers’ state fired people’s imagination across the world. In
many countries, communist parties were formed – like the
Communist Party of Great Britain. The Bolsheviks encouraged
colonial peoples to follow their experiment. Many non-Russians from
outside the USSR participated in the Conference of the Peoples of
the East (1920) and the Bolshevik-founded Comintern (an international
union of pro-Bolshevik socialist parties). Some received education in
the USSR’s Communist University of the Workers of the East. By
the time of the outbreak of the Second World War, the USSR had
given socialism a global face and world stature.
Yet by the 1950s it was acknowledged within the country that the
style of government in the USSR was not in keeping with the ideals
of the Russian Revolution. In the world socialist movement too it
was recognised that all was not well in the Soviet Union. A backward
country had become a great power. Its industries and agriculture
had developed and the poor were being fed. But it had denied the
essential freedoms to its citizens and carried out its developmental
projects through repressive policies. By the end of the twentieth
century, the international reputation of the USSR as a socialist
country had declined though it was recognised that socialist ideals
still enjoyed respect among its people. But in each country the ideas
of socialism were rethought in a variety of different ways.
5 The Global Influence of the Russian
Revolution and the USSR
Writing about the Russian Revolution in India
Among those the Russian Revolution inspired were many Indians. Several
attended the Communist University. By the mid-1920s the Communist Party was
formed in India. Its members kept in touch with the Soviet Communist Party.
Important Indian political and cultural figures took an interest in the Soviet
experiment and visited Russia, among them Jawaharlal Nehru and Rabindranath
Tagore, who wrote about Soviet Socialism. In India, writings gave impressions of
Soviet Russia. In Hindi, R.S. Avasthi wrote in 1920-21 Russian Revolution, Lenin,
His Life and His Thoughts, and later The Red Revolution . S.D. Vidyalankar
wrote The Rebirth of Russia and The Soviet State of Russia. There was much
that was written in Bengali, Marathi, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu.

‘For the first time in our lives, we were seeing Europeans
mixing freely with Asians. On seeing the Russians mingling
freely with the rest of the people of the country we were
convinced that we had come to a land of real equality.
We saw freedom in its true light. In spite of their poverty,
imposed by the counter-revolutionaries and the imperialists,
the people were more jovial and satisfied than ever before.
The revolution had instilled confidence and fearlessness in
them. The real brotherhood of mankind would be seen here
among these people of fifty different nationalities. No
barriers of caste or religion hindered them from mixing freely
with one another. Every soul was transformed into an orator.
One could see a worker, a peasant or a soldier haranguing

‘Moscow appears much less clean than the other
European capitals. None of those hurrying along the
streets look smart. The whole place belongs to the
workers … Here the masses have not in the least been
put in the shade by the gentlemen … those who lived in
the background for ages have come forward in the open
today … I thought of the peasants and workers in my
own country. It all seemed like the work of the Genii in
the Arabian Nights. [here] only a decade ago they were
as illiterate, helpless and hungry as our own masses …
Who could be more astonished than an unfortunate Indian
like myself to see how they had removed the mountain of
ignorance and helplessness in these few years’.

In the spring of 1945, a little eleven-year-old German boy called
Helmuth was lying in bed when he overheard his parents discussing
something in serious tones. His father, a prominent physician,
deliberated with his wife whether the time had come to kill the entire
family, or if he should commit suicide alone. His father spoke about
his fear of revenge, saying, ‘Now the Allies will do to us what we did to
the crippled and Jews.’ The next day, he took Helmuth to the woods,
where they spent their last happy time together, singing old children’s
songs. Later, Helmuth’s father shot himself in his office. Helmuth
remembers that he saw his father’s bloody uniform being burnt in the
family fireplace. So traumatised was he by what he had overheard and
what had happened, that he reacted by refusing to eat at home for the
following nine years! He was afraid that his mother might poison him.
Although Helmuth may not have realised all that it meant, his father
had been a Nazi and a supporter of Adolf Hitler. Many of you will
know something about the Nazis and Hitler. You probably know
of Hitler’s determination to make Germany into a mighty power
and his ambition of conquering all of Europe. You may have heard
that he killed Jews. But Nazism was not one or two isolated acts. It
was a system, a structure of ideas about the world and politics. Let
us try and understand what Nazism was all about. Let us see why
Helmuth’s father killed himself and what the basis of his fear was.
In May 1945, Germany surrendered to the Allies. Anticipating what
was coming, Hitler, his propaganda minister Goebbels and his entire
family committed suicide collectively in his Berlin bunker in April.
At the end of the war, an International Military Tribunal at
Nuremberg was set up to prosecute Nazi war criminals for Crimes
against Peace, for War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity.

came to be called Crimes Against Humanity, raised serious moral
and ethical questions and invited worldwide condemnation. What
were these acts?
Under the shadow of the Second World War, Germany had waged
a genocidal war, which resulted in the mass murder of selected
groups of innocent civilians of Europe. The number of people killed
included 6 million Jews, 200,000 Gypsies, 1 million Polish civilians,
70,000 Germans who were considered mentally and physically
disabled, besides innumerable political opponents. Nazis devised
an unprecedented means of killing people, that is, by gassing them in
various killing centres like Auschwitz. The Nuremberg Tribunal
sentenced only eleven leading Nazis to death. Many others were
imprisoned for life. The retribution did come, yet the punishment
of the Nazis was far short of the brutality and extent of their crimes.
The Allies did not want to be as harsh on defeated Germany as
they had been after the First World War.
Everyone came to feel that the rise of Nazi Germany could be
partly traced back to the German experience at the end of the
First World War.

Germany, a powerful empire in the early years of the twentieth
century, fought the First World War (1914-1918) alongside the
Austrian empire and against the Allies (England, France and Russia.)
All joined the war enthusiastically hoping to gain from a quick
victory. Little did they realise that the war would stretch on,
eventually draining Europe of all its resources. Germany made initial
gains by occupying France and Belgium. However the Allies,
strengthened by the US entry in 1917, won , defeating Germany and the
Central Powers in November 1918.
The defeat of Imperial Germany and the abdication of the emperor
gave an opportunity to parliamentary parties to recast German polity.
A National Assembly met at Weimar and established a democratic
constitution with a federal structure. Deputies were now elected to
the German Parliament or Reichstag, on the basis of equal and
universal votes cast by all adults including women.
This republic, however, was not received well by its own people
largely because of the terms it was forced to accept after Germany’s
defeat at the end of the First World War. The peace treaty at

1.1 The Effects of the War
The war had a devastating impact on the entire continent both
psychologically and financially. From a continent of creditors,
Europe turned into one of debtors. Unfortunately, the infant Weimar
Republic was being made to pay for the sins of the old empire. The
republic carried the burden of war guilt and national humiliation
and was financially crippled by being forced to pay compensation.
Those who supported the Weimar Republic, mainly Socialists, Catholics
and Democrats, became easy targets of attack in the conservative
nationalist circles. They were mockingly called the ‘November criminals’.
This mindset had a major impact on the political developments of the
early 1930s, as we will soon see.
The First World War left a deep imprint on European society and
polity. Soldiers came to be placed above civilians. Politicians and
publicists laid great stress on the need for men to be aggressive, strong
and masculine. The media glorified trench life. The truth, however,
was that soldiers lived miserable lives in these trenches, trapped with
rats feeding on corpses. They faced poisonous gas and enemy shelling,
and witnessed their ranks reduce rapidly. Aggressive war propaganda
and national honour occupied centre stage in the public sphere, while
popular support grew for conservative dictatorships that had recently
come into being. Democracy was indeed a young and fragile idea,
which could not survive the instabilities of interwar Europe.
1.2 Political Radicalism and Economic Crises
The birth of the Weimar Republic coincided with the revolutionary
uprising of the Spartacist League on the pattern of the Bolshevik
Revolution in Russia. Soviets of workers and sailors were established
Versailles with the Allies was a harsh and humiliating peace. Germany lost
its overseas colonies, a tenth of its population, 13 per cent of its territories,
75 per cent of its iron and 26 per cent of its coal to France, Poland,
Denmark and Lithuania. The Allied Powers demilitarised Germany to
weaken its power. The War Guilt Clause held Germany responsible for
the war and damages the Allied countries suffered. Germany was forced
to pay compensation amounting to £6 billion. The Allied armies also
occupied the resource-rich Rhineland for much of the 1920s. Many
Germans held the new Weimar Republic responsible for not only the
defeat in the war but the disgrace at Versailles.

in many cities. The political atmosphere in Berlin was charged with
demands for Soviet-style governance. Those opposed to this – such
as the socialists, Democrats and Catholics – met in Weimar to give
shape to the democratic republic. The Weimar Republic crushed the
uprising with the help of a war veterans organisation called Free
Corps. The anguished Spartacists later founded the Communist Party of
Germany. Communists and Socialists henceforth became irreconcilable
enemies and could not make common cause against Hitler. Both
revolutionaries and militant nationalists craved for radical solutions.
Political radicalisation was only heightened by the economic crisis
of 1923. Germany had fought the war largely on loans and had to
pay war reparations in gold. This depleted gold reserves at a time
resources were scarce. In 1923 Germany refused to pay, and the
French occupied its leading industrial area, Ruhr, to claim their coal.
Germany retaliated with passive resistance and printed paper currency
recklessly. With too much printed money in circulation, the value
of the German mark fell. In April the US dollar was equal to 24,000
marks, in July 353,000 marks, in August 4,621,000 marks and at

98,860,000 marks by December, the figure had run into trillions. As
the value of the mark collapsed, prices of goods soared. The image of
Germans carrying cartloads of currency notes to buy a loaf of bread
was widely publicised evoking worldwide sympathy. This crisis came
to be known as hyperinflation, a situation when prices rise
phenomenally high.
Eventually, the Americans intervened and bailed Germany out of
the crisis by introducing the Dawes Plan, which reworked the terms
of reparation to ease the financial burden on Germans.
1.3 The Years of Depression
The years between 1924 and 1928 saw some stability. Yet this was
built on sand. German investments and industrial recovery were
totally dependent on short-term loans, largely from the USA. This
support was withdrawn when the Wall Street Exchange crashed in
1929. Fearing a fall in prices, people made frantic efforts to sell their
shares. On one single day, 24 October, 13 million shares were sold.
This was the start of the Great Economic Depression. Over the next
three years, between 1929 and 1932, the national income of the USA
fell by half. Factories shut down, exports fell, farmers were badly hit
and speculators withdrew their money from the market. The effects
of this recession in the US economy were felt worldwide.
The German economy was the worst hit by the economic crisis. By
1932, industrial production was reduced to 40 per cent of the 1929
level. Workers lost their jobs or were paid reduced wages. The number
of unemployed touched an unprecedented 6 million. On the streets
of Germany you could see men with placards around their necks
saying, ‘Willing to do any work’. Unemployed youths played cards
or simply sat at street corners, or desperately queued up at the local
employment exchange. As jobs disappeared, the youth took to
criminal activities and total despair became commonplace.
The economic crisis created deep anxieties and fears in people. The
middle classes, especially salaried employees and pensioners, saw
their savings diminish when the currency lost its value. Small
businessmen, the self-employed and retailers suffered as their

businesses got ruined. These sections of society were filled with the
fear of proletarianisation, an anxiety of being reduced to the ranks
of the working class, or worse still, the unemployed. Only organised
workers could manage to keep their heads above water, but
unemployment weakened their bargaining power. Big business was
in crisis. The large mass of peasantry was affected by a sharp fall in
agricultural prices and women, unable to fill their children’s
stomachs, were filled with a sense of deep despair.
Politically too the Weimar Republic was fragile. The Weimar
constitution had some inherent defects, which made it unstable
and vulnerable to dictatorship. One was proportional
representation. This made achieving a majority by any one party a
near impossible task, leading to a rule by coalitions. Another defect
was Article 48, which gave the President the powers to impose
emergency, suspend civil rights and rule by decree. Within its short
life, the Weimar Republic saw twenty different cabinets lasting on
an average 239 days, and a liberal use of Article 48. Yet the crisis
could not be managed. People lost confidence in the democratic
parliamentary system, which seemed to offer no solutions.

This crisis in the economy, polity and society formed the background
to Hitler’s rise to power. Born in 1889 in Austria, Hitler spent his
youth in poverty. When the First World War broke out, he enrolled
for the army, acted as a messenger in the front, became a corporal, and
earned medals for bravery. The German defeat horrified him and the
Versailles Treaty made him furious. In 1919, he joined a small group
called the German Workers’ Party. He subsequently took over the
organisation and renamed it the National Socialist German Workers’
Party. This party came to be known as the Nazi Party.
In 1923, Hitler planned to seize control of Bavaria, march to Berlin
and capture power. He failed, was arrested, tried for treason, and
later released. The Nazis could not effectively mobilise popular
support till the early 1930s. It was during the Great Depression that
Nazism became a mass movement. As we have seen, after 1929, banks
collapsed and businesses shut down, workers lost their jobs and the
middle classes were threatened with destitution. In such a situation
Nazi propaganda stirred hopes of a better future. In 1928, the Nazi
Party got no more than 2. 6 per cent votes in the Reichstag – the
German parliament. By 1932, it had become the largest party with
37 per cent votes.

Hitler was a powerful speaker. His passion and his words moved
people. He promised to build a strong nation, undo the injustice of
the Versailles Treaty and restore the dignity of the German people.
He promised employment for those looking for work, and a secure
future for the youth. He promised to weed out all foreign influences
and resist all foreign ‘conspiracies’ against Germany.
Hitler devised a new style of politics. He understood the significance
of rituals and spectacle in mass mobilisation. Nazis held massive rallies
and public meetings to demonstrate the support for Hitler and instil
a sense of unity among the people. The Red banners with the
Swastika, the Nazi salute, and the ritualised rounds of applause after
the speeches were all part of this spectacle of power.

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005 recommends that children’s life
at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a
departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system
and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks
developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea.
They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries
between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly
further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National
Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers
will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue
imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and
freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed
on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination
is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.
Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as
participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.
Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar
so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods
used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves
for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or
boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by
restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for
child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance
this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation
and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on
experience.
NCERT appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee
responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the Advisory Group
on Social Science, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for this book,
Professor Neeladri Bhattacharya for guiding the work of this committee. Several

We live in a world where the existence of nations is taken for granted. We see people as
belonging to nations and having a nationality, and we assume that this sense of belonging
has existed from time immemorial. We consider countries as the same as nations, and use
the two terms as synonyms, making little distinction between them. We think of countries
as unified entities, each with a demarcated international boundary, a defined territory, a
national language, and a central government.
Yet if we were to travel in a time capsule to the mid-eighteenth century and look for nations
as we know them today, we would not find them. If we were to ask people about their
nationality, about their national identity, they would not understand our questions. For at that
time, nations did not exist in their modern form. People lived within kingdoms, small states,
principalities, chiefdoms and duchies, not within nations. As Eric Hobsbawm, a famous historian,
once said, the most remarkable fact about the modern nation is its modernity. The history of
its existence is no more than 250 years old.
How did the modern nation come into being? How did people begin to see themselves as
belonging to a nation?
The sense of belonging to a nation developed only over a period of time. The first two
chapters (in Section I) of this book will trace this history. You will see how the idea of nationalism
emerged in Europe, how territories were unified, and national governments formed. It was a
process that took many decades, involved many wars and revolutions, many ideological battles
and political conflicts. From a discussion of Europe (Chapter I) we will shift our focus to the
growth of nationalism in India (Chapter II), where nationalism was shaped by the experience
of colonialism and the anti-imperialist movement. It will help you understand how nationalism
in colonial countries can develop in a variety of ways, glorify contrasting ideals, and be linked
to different modes of struggle.
The story of nationalism in these chapters will move at several levels. You will of course read
about great leaders like Giuseppe Mazzini and Mahatma Gandhi. But we cannot understand
nationalism only by knowing about the words and deeds of important leaders, and the big
and dramatic events they led and participated in. We have to also look at the aspirations and
activities of ordinary people, see how nationalism is expressed in small events of everyday life,
and shaped by a variety of seemingly dissimilar and unrelated social movements. To understand
how nationalism spreads, we need to know not only what the leaders said, but also how their
words were understood and interpreted by people. If we are to think about how people
begin to identify with a nation, we must see not only the political events that are critical to the
process, but also how nationalist sensibilities are nurtured by artists and writers, and through
art and literature, songs and tales.
In Section II, we will shift our focus to economies and livelihoods. Last year you read about
those social groups — pastoralists and forest dwellers — who are often seen as survivors
from past times when in fact they are very much part of the modern world we live in. This
year we will focus on developments that are seen as symbolising modernity – globalisation
and industrialisation – and see the many sides of the history of these developments.
In Chapter III you will see how the global world has emerged out of a long and complicated
history. From ancient times, pilgrims, traders, travelers have traversed distances, carrying goods,
information and skills, linking societies in ways that often had contradictory consequences.

information and taste, as well as disease and death. As Western powers carried the flag of
‘civilisation’ deep into different parts of Africa, precious metals and slaves were taken
away to Europe and America. When coffee and sugar were grown in the Caribbean
plantations for the world market, an oppressive system of indentured labour came into
being in India and China to supply workers for the plantations.
Section III will introduce you to the history of print culture. Surrounded by things that
appear in print, we might find it difficult today to imagine a time when printing was still
unknown. Chapter V will trace how the history of the contemporary world is intimately
connected with the growth of print. You will see how printing made possible the spread
of information and ideas, debates and discussions, advertising and propaganda, and a
variety of new forms of literature.
When we discuss such themes of everyday life, we begin to see how history can help us
reflect on even the seemingly ordinary things in the world.

Nationalism in Europe
In 1848, Frédéric Sorrieu, a French artist, prepared a series of four
prints visualising his dream of a world made up of ‘democratic
and social Republics’, as he called them. The first print (Fig. 1) of the
series, shows the peoples of Europe and America – men and women
of all ages and social classes – marching in a long train, and offering
homage to the statue of Liberty as they pass by it. As you would
recall, artists of the time of the French Revolution personified Liberty
as a female figure – here you can recognise the torch of Enlightenment
she bears in one hand and the Charter of the Rights of Man in the
other. On the earth in the foreground of the image lie the shattered
remains of the symbols of absolutist institutions. In Sorrieu’s
utopian vision, the peoples of the world are grouped as distinct
nations, identified through their flags and national costume. Leading
the procession, way past the statue of Liberty, are the United States
and Switzerland, which by this time were already nation-states. France,

identifiable by the revolutionary tricolour, has just reached the statue.
She is followed by the peoples of Germany, bearing the black, red
and gold flag. Interestingly, at the time when Sorrieu created this
image, the German peoples did not yet exist as a united nation – the
flag they carry is an expression of liberal hopes in 1848 to unify the
numerous German-speaking principalities into a nation-state under
a democratic constitution. Following the German peoples are the
peoples of Austria, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, Lombardy,
Poland, England, Ireland, Hungary and Russia. From the heavens
above, Christ, saints and angels gaze upon the scene. They have
been used by the artist to symbolise fraternity among the nations of
the world.
This chapter will deal with many of the issues visualised by Sorrieu
in Fig. 1. During the nineteenth century, nationalism emerged as a
force which brought about sweeping changes in the political and
mental world of Europe. The end result of these changes was the
emergence of the nation-state in place of the multi-national dynastic
empires of Europe. The concept and practices of a modern state, in
which a centralised power exercised sovereign control over a clearly
defined territory, had been developing over a long period of time
in Europe. But a nation-state was one in which the majority of its
citizens, and not only its rulers, came to develop a sense of common
identity and shared history or descent. This commonness did not
exist from time immemorial; it was forged through struggles, through
the actions of leaders and the common people. This chapter will
look at the diverse processes through which nation-states and
nationalism came into being in nineteenth-century Europe.
Ernst Renan, ‘What is a Nation?’
In a lecture delivered at the University of
Sorbonne in 1882, the French philosopher Ernst
Renan (1823-92) outlined his understanding of
what makes a nation. The lecture was
subsequently published as a famous essay entitled
‘Qu’est-ce qu’une nation?’ (‘What is a Nation?’).
In this essay Renan criticises the notion suggested
by others that a nation is formed by a common
language, race, religion, or territory:
‘A nation is the culmination of a long past of
endeavours, sacrifice and devotion. A heroic past,
great men, glory, that is the social capital upon
which one bases a national idea. To have
common glories in the past, to have a common
will in the present, to have performed great deeds
together, to wish to perform still more, these
are the essential conditions of being a people. A
nation is therefore a large-scale solidarity … Its
existence is a daily plebiscite … A province is its
inhabitants; if anyone has the right to be
consulted, it is the inhabitant. A nation never
has any real interest in annexing or holding on to
a country against its will. The existence of nations
is a good thing, a necessity even. Their existence
is a guarantee of liberty, which would be lost if
the world had only one law and only one master.’

Nationalism in Europe
1 The French Revolution and the Idea of the Nation
The first clear expression of nationalism came with
the French Revolution in 1789. France, as you
would remember, was a full-fledged territorial state
in 1789 under the rule of an absolute monarch.
The political and constitutional changes that came
in the wake of the French Revolution led to the
transfer of sovereignty from the monarchy to a
body of French citizens. The revolution proclaimed
that it was the people who would henceforth
constitute the nation and shape its destiny.
From the very beginning, the French revolutionaries
introduced various measures and practices that
could create a sense of collective identity amongst
the French people. The ideas of la patrie (the
fatherland) and le citoyen (the citizen) emphasised
the notion of a united community enjoying equal rights under a
constitution. A new French flag, the tricolour, was chosen to replace
the former royal standard. The Estates General was elected by the
body of active citizens and renamed the National Assembly. New
hymns were composed, oaths taken and martyrs commemorated,
all in the name of the nation. A centralised administrative system
was put in place and it formulated uniform laws for all citizens
within its territory. Internal customs duties and dues were abolished
and a uniform system of weights and measures was adopted.
Regional dialects were discouraged and French, as it was spoken
and written in Paris, became the common language of the nation.
The revolutionaries further declared that it was the mission and the
destiny of the French nation to liberate the peoples of Europe
from despotism, in other words to help other peoples of Europe
to become nations.
When the news of the events in France reached the different cities
of Europe, students and other members of educated middle classes
began setting up Jacobin clubs. Their activities and campaigns
prepared the way for the French armies which moved into Holland,
Belgium, Switzerland and much of Italy in the 1790s. With the
outbreak of the revolutionary wars, the French armies began to
carry the idea of nationalism abroad.

and was a member of a German Jacobin group.

Within the wide swathe of territory that came under his control,
Napoleon set about introducing many of the reforms that he had
already introduced in France. Through a return to monarchy
Napoleon had, no doubt, destroyed democracy in France, but in
the administrative field he had incorporated revolutionary principles
in order to make the whole system more rational and efficient. The
Civil Code of 1804 – usually known as the Napoleonic Code –
did away with all privileges based on birth, established equality
before the law and secured the right to property. This Code was
exported to the regions under French control. In the Dutch Republic,
in Switzerland, in Italy and Germany, Napoleon simplified
administrative divisions, abolished the feudal system and freed
peasants from serfdom and manorial dues. In the towns too, guild
restrictions were removed. Transport and communication systems
were improved. Peasants, artisans, workers and new businessmen

enjoyed a new-found freedom. Businessmen and small-scale
producers of goods, in particular, began to realise that uniform
laws, standardised weights and measures, and a common national
currency would facilitate the movement and exchange of goods
and capital from one region to another.
However, in the areas conquered, the reactions of the local
populations to French rule were mixed. Initially, in many places such
as Holland and Switzerland, as well as in certain cities like Brussels,
Mainz, Milan and Warsaw, the French armies were welcomed as
harbingers of liberty. But the initial enthusiasm soon turned to hostility,
as it became clear that the new administrative arrangements did not
go hand in hand with political freedom. Increased taxation,
censorship, forced conscription into the French armies required to
conquer the rest of Europe, all seemed to outweigh the advantages
of the administrative changes.

The subject of this colour print by the German painter Karl Kaspar Fritz is the occupation of the town of Zweibrücken
by the French armies. French soldiers, recognisable by their blue, white and red uniforms, have been portrayed as
oppressors as they seize a peasant’s cart (left), harass some young women (centre foreground) and force a peasant
down to his knees. The plaque being affixed to the Tree of Liberty carries a German inscription which in translation
reads: ‘Take freedom and equality from us, the model of humanity.’ This is a sarcastic reference to the claim of the
French as being liberators who opposed monarchy in the territories they entered.

If you look at the map of mid-eighteenth-century Europe you will
find that there were no ‘nation-states’ as we know them today.
What we know today as Germany, Italy and Switzerland were
divided into kingdoms, duchies and cantons whose rulers had their
autonomous territories. Eastern and Central Europe were under
autocratic monarchies within the territories of which lived diverse
peoples. They did not see themselves as sharing a collective identity
or a common culture. Often, they even spoke different languages
and belonged to different ethnic groups. The Habsburg Empire
that ruled over Austria-Hungary, for example, was a patchwork of
many different regions and peoples. It included the Alpine regions
– the Tyrol, Austria and the Sudetenland – as well as Bohemia,
where the aristocracy was predominantly German-speaking. It also
included the Italian-speaking provinces of Lombardy and Venetia.
In Hungary, half of the population spoke Magyar while the other
half spoke a variety of dialects. In Galicia, the aristocracy spoke
Polish. Besides these three dominant groups, there also lived within
the boundaries of the empire, a mass of subject peasant peoples –
Bohemians and Slovaks to the north, Slovenes in Carniola, Croats
to the south, and Roumans to the east in Transylvania. Such
differences did not easily promote a sense of political unity. The
only tie binding these diverse groups together was a common
allegiance to the emperor.
How did nationalism and the idea of the nation-state emerge?
2.1 The Aristocracy and the New Middle Class
Socially and politically, a landed aristocracy was the dominant class
on the continent. The members of this class were united by a
common way of life that cut across regional divisions. They owned
estates in the countryside and also town-houses. They spoke French
for purposes of diplomacy and in high society. Their families were
often connected by ties of marriage. This powerful aristocracy was,
however, numerically a small group. The majority of the population
was made up of the peasantry. To the west, the bulk of the land
was farmed by tenants and small owners, while in Eastern and
Central Europe the pattern of landholding was characterised by
vast estates which were cultivated by serfs.

Nationalism in Europe
In Western and parts of Central Europe the growth of industrial
production and trade meant the growth of towns and the emergence
of commercial classes whose existence was based on production
for the market. Industrialisation began in England in the second
half of the eighteenth century, but in France and parts of the German
states it occurred only during the nineteenth century. In its wake,
new social groups came into being: a working-class population, and
middle classes made up of industrialists, businessmen, professionals.
In Central and Eastern Europe these groups were smaller in number
till late nineteenth century. It was among the educated, liberal middle
classes that ideas of national unity following the abolition of
aristocratic privileges gained popularity.
2.2 What did Liberal Nationalism Stand for?
Ideas of national unity in early-nineteenth-century Europe were closely
allied to the ideology of liberalism. The term ‘liberalism’ derives
from the Latin root liber, meaning free. For the new middle classes
liberalism stood for freedom for the individual and equality of all
before the law. Politically, it emphasised the concept of government
by consent. Since the French Revolution, liberalism had stood for
the end of autocracy and clerical privileges, a constitution and
representative government through parliament. Nineteenth-century
liberals also stressed the inviolability of private property.
Yet, equality before the law did not necessarily stand for universal
suffrage. You will recall that in revolutionary France, which marked
the first political experiment in liberal democracy, the right to vote
and to get elected was granted exclusively to property-owning men.
Men without property and all women were excluded from political
rights. Only for a brief period under the Jacobins did all adult males
enjoy suffrage. However, the Napoleonic Code went back to limited
suffrage and reduced women to the status of a minor, subject to
the authority of fathers and husbands. Throughout the nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries women and non-propertied men
organised opposition movements demanding equal political rights.
In the economic sphere, liberalism stood for the freedom of markets
and the abolition of state-imposed restrictions on the movement
of goods and capital. During the nineteenth century this was a strong
demand of the emerging middle classes. Let us take the example of
the German-speaking regions in the first half of the nineteenth
century. Napoleon’s administrative measures had created out of

countless small principalities a confederation of 39 states. Each of
these possessed its own currency, and weights and measures. A
merchant travelling in 1833 from Hamburg to Nuremberg to sell
his goods would have had to pass through 11 customs barriers and
pay a customs duty of about 5 per cent at each one of them. Duties
were often levied according to the weight or measurement of the
goods. As each region had its own system of weights and measures,
this involved time-consuming calculation. The measure of cloth,
for example, was the elle which in each region stood for a different
length. An elle of textile material bought in Frankfurt would get you
54.7 cm of cloth, in Mainz 55.1 cm, in Nuremberg 65.6 cm, in
Freiburg 53.5 cm.
Such conditions were viewed as obstacles to economic exchange
and growth by the new commercial classes, who argued for the
creation of a unified economic territory allowing the unhindered
movement of goods, people and capital. In 1834, a customs union
or zollverein was formed at the initiative of Prussia and joined by
most of the German states. The union abolished tariff barriers and
reduced the number of currencies from over thirty to two. The
creation of a network of railways further stimulated mobility,
harnessing economic interests to national unification. A wave of
economic nationalism strengthened the wider nationalist sentiments
growing at the time.
2.3 A New Conservatism after 1815
Following the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, European governments
were driven by a spirit of conservatism. Conservatives believed
that established, traditional institutions of state and society – like the
monarchy, the Church, social hierarchies, property and the family –
should be preserved. Most conservatives, however, did not propose
a return to the society of pre-revolutionary days. Rather, they realised,
from the changes initiated by Napoleon, that modernisation could
in fact strengthen traditional institutions like the monarchy. It could
make state power more effective and strong. A modern army, an
efficient bureaucracy, a dynamic economy, the abolition of feudalism
and serfdom could strengthen the autocratic monarchies of Europe.
In 1815, representatives of the European powers – Britain, Russia,
Prussia and Austria – who had collectively defeated Napoleon, met
at Vienna to draw up a settlement for Europe. The Congress was
hosted by the Austrian Chancellor Duke Metternich. The delegates
Economists began to think in terms of the national
economy. They talked of how the nation could
develop and what economic measures could help
forge this nation together.
Friedrich List, Professor of Economics at the
University of Tübingen in Germany, wrote in 1834:
‘The aim of the zollverein is to bind the Germans
economically into a nation. It will strengthen the
nation materially as much by protecting its
interests externally as by stimulating its internal
productivity. It ought to awaken and raise
national sentiment through a fusion of individual
and provincial interests. The German people have
realised that a free economic system is the only
means to engender national feeling.’

drew up the Treaty of Vienna of 1815 with the object of undoing
most of the changes that had come about in Europe during the
Napoleonic wars. The Bourbon dynasty, which had been deposed
during the French Revolution, was restored to power, and France
lost the territories it had annexed under Napoleon. A series of states
were set up on the boundaries of France to prevent French expansion
in future. Thus the kingdom of the Netherlands, which included
Belgium, was set up in the north and Genoa was added to Piedmont
in the south. Prussia was given important new territories on its western
frontiers, while Austria was given control of northern Italy. But the
German confederation of 39 states that had been set up by Napoleon
was left untouched. In the east, Russia was given part of Poland
while Prussia was given a portion of Saxony. The main intention
was to restore the monarchies that had been overthrown by
Napoleon, and create a new conservative order in Europe.
Conservative regimes set up in 1815 were autocratic. They did not
tolerate criticism and dissent, and sought to curb activities that
questioned the legitimacy of autocratic governments. Most of them
imposed censorship laws to control what was said in newspapers,
books, plays and songs and reflected the ideas of liberty and freedom

associated with the French Revolution. The memory of the French
Revolution nonetheless continued to inspire liberals. One of the major
issues taken up by the liberal-nationalists, who criticised the new
conservative order, was freedom of the press.
2.4 The Revolutionaries
During the years following 1815, the fear of repression drove many
liberal-nationalists underground. Secret societies sprang up in many
European states to train revolutionaries and spread their ideas. To
be revolutionary at this time meant a commitment to oppose
monarchical forms that had been established after the Vienna
Congress, and to fight for liberty and freedom. Most of these
revolutionaries also saw the creation of nation-states as a necessary
part of this struggle for freedom.
One such individual was the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Mazzini.
Born in Genoa in 1807, he became a member of the secret society
of the Carbonari. As a young man of 24, he was sent into exile in
1831 for attempting a revolution in Liguria. He subsequently founded
two more underground societies, first, Young Italy in Marseilles,
and then, Young Europe in Berne, whose members were like-minded
young men from Poland, France, Italy and the German states.
Mazzini believed that God had intended nations to be the natural
units of mankind. So Italy could not continue to be a patchwork of
small states and kingdoms. It had to be forged into a single unified
republic within a wider alliance of nations. This unification alone
could be the basis of Italian liberty. Following his model, secret
societies were set up in Germany, France, Switzerland and Poland.
Mazzini’s relentless opposition to monarchy and his vision of
democratic republics frightened the conservatives. Metternich
described him as ‘the most dangerous enemy of our social order’.

Nationalism in Europe
3 The Age of Revolutions: 1830-1848
As conservative regimes tried to consolidate their power, liberalism
and nationalism came to be increasingly associated with revolution
in many regions of Europe such as the Italian and German states,
the provinces of the Ottoman Empire, Ireland and Poland. These
revolutions were led by the liberal-nationalists belonging to the
educated middle-class elite, among whom were professors, school-
teachers, clerks and members of the commercial middle classes.
The first upheaval took place in France in July 1830. The Bourbon
kings who had been restored to power during the conservative
reaction after 1815, were now overthrown by liberal revolutionaries
who installed a constitutional monarchy with Louis Philippe at its
head. ‘When France sneezes,’ Metternich once remarked, ‘the rest of
Europe catches cold.’ The July Revolution sparked an uprising in
Brussels which led to Belgium breaking away from the United
Kingdom of the Netherlands.
An event that mobilised nationalist feelings among the educated elite
across Europe was the Greek war of independence. Greece had
been part of the Ottoman Empire since the fifteenth century. The
growth of revolutionary nationalism in Europe sparked off a struggle
for independence amongst the Greeks which began in 1821.
Nationalists in Greece got support from other Greeks living in exile
and also from many West Europeans who had sympathies for ancient
Greek culture. Poets and artists lauded Greece as the cradle of
European civilisation and mobilised public opinion to support its
struggle against a Muslim empire. The English poet Lord Byron
organised funds and later went to fight in the war, where he died of
fever in 1824. Finally, the Treaty of Constantinople of 1832
recognised Greece as an independent nation.
3.1 The Romantic Imagination and National Feeling
The development of nationalism did not come about only through
wars and territorial expansion. Culture played an important role in
creating the idea of the nation: art and poetry, stories and music
helped express and shape nationalist feelings.
Let us look at Romanticism, a cultural movement which sought to
develop a particular form of nationalist sentiment. Romantic artists
and poets generally criticised the glorification of reason and science

The French painter Delacroix was one of the most important French Romantic
painters. This huge painting (4.19m x 3.54m) depicts an incident in which
20,000 Greeks were said to have been killed by Turks on the island of Chios. By
dramatising the incident, focusing on the suffering of women and children, and
using vivid colours, Delacroix sought to appeal to the emotions of the spectators,
and create sympathy for the Greeks.
and focused instead on emotions, intuition and mystical feelings.
Their effort was to create a sense of a shared collective heritage, a
common cultural past, as the basis of a nation.
Other Romantics such as the German philosopher Johann Gottfried
Herder (1744-1803) claimed that true German culture was to be
discovered among the common people – das volk. It was through
folk songs, folk poetry and folk dances that the true spirit of the
nation (volksgeist) was popularised. So collecting and recording these
forms of folk culture was essential to the project of nation-building.

The Grimm Brothers: Folktales and
Nation-building
Grimms’ Fairy Tales is a familiar name. The brothers
Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were born in the
German city of Hanau in 1785 and 1786
respectively. While both of them studied law,
they soon developed an interest in collecting old
folktales. They spent six years travelling from
village to village, talking to people and writing
down fairy tales, which were handed down
through the generations. These were popular
both among children and adults. In 1812, they
published their first collection of tales.
Subsequently, both the brothers became active
in liberal politics, especially the movement
for freedom of the press. In the meantime they
also published a 33-volume dictionary of the
German language.
The Grimm brothers also saw French domination
as a threat to German culture, and believed that
the folktales they had collected were expressions
of a pure and authentic German spirit. They
considered their projects of collecting folktales
and developing the German language as part of
the wider effort to oppose French domination
and create a German national identity.
The emphasis on vernacular language and the collection of local
folklore was not just to recover an ancient national spirit, but also to
carry the modern nationalist message to large audiences who were
mostly illiterate. This was especially so in the case of Poland, which
had been partitioned at the end of the eighteenth century by the
Great Powers – Russia, Prussia and Austria. Even though Poland no
longer existed as an independent territory, national feelings were kept
alive through music and language. Karol Kurpinski, for example,
celebrated the national struggle through his operas and music, turning
folk dances like the polonaise and mazurka into nationalist symbols.
Language too played an important role in developing nationalist
sentiments. After Russian occupation, the Polish language was forced
out of schools and the Russian language was imposed everywhere.
In 1831, an armed rebellion against Russian rule took place which
was ultimately crushed. Following this, many members of the clergy
in Poland began to use language as a weapon of national resistance.
Polish was used for Church gatherings and all religious instruction.
As a result, a large number of priests and bishops were put in jail or
sent to Siberia by the Russian authorities as punishment for their
refusal to preach in Russian. The use of Polish came to be seen as a
symbol of the struggle against Russian dominance.
3.2 Hunger, Hardship and Popular Revolt
The 1830s were years of great economic hardship in Europe. The
first half of the nineteenth century saw an enormous increase in
population all over Europe. In most countries there were more
seekers of jobs than employment. Population from rural areas
migrated to the cities to live in overcrowded slums. Small producers
in towns were often faced with stiff competition from imports of
cheap machine-made goods from England, where industrialisation
was more advanced than on the continent. This was especially so in
textile production, which was carried out mainly in homes or small
workshops and was only partly mechanised. In those regions of
Europe where the aristocracy still enjoyed power, peasants struggled
under the burden of feudal dues and obligations. The rise of food
prices or a year of bad harvest led to widespread pauperism in
town and country.
The year 1848 was one such year. Food shortages and widespread
unemployment brought the population of Paris out on the roads.
Barricades were erected and Louis Philippe was forced to flee. A

National Assembly proclaimed a Republic, granted suffrage to all
adult males above 21, and guaranteed the right to work. National
workshops to provide employment were set up.
Earlier, in 1845, weavers in Silesia had led a revolt against contractors
who supplied them raw material and gave them orders for finished
textiles but drastically reduced their payments. The journalist Wilhelm
Wolff described the events in a Silesian village as follows:
In these villages (with 18,000 inhabitants) cotton weaving is the
most widespread occupation … The misery of the workers is
extreme. The desperate need for jobs has been taken advantage
of by the contractors to reduce the prices of the goods they
order …
On 4 June at 2 p.m. a large crowd of weavers emerged from
their homes and marched in pairs up to the mansion of their
contractor demanding higher wages. They were treated with
scorn and threats alternately. Following this, a group of them
forced their way into the house, smashed its elegant window-
panes, furniture, porcelain … another group broke into the
storehouse and plundered it of supplies of cloth which they
tore to shreds … The contractor fled with his family to a
neighbouring village which, however, refused to shelter such a
person. He returned 24 hours later having requisitioned the army.
In the exchange that followed, eleven weavers were shot.

Nationalism in Europe
3.3 1848: The Revolution of the Liberals
Parallel to the revolts of the poor, unemployed and starving peasants
and workers in many European countries in the year 1848, a revolution
led by the educated middle classes was under way. Events of February
1848 in France had brought about the abdication of the monarch
and a republic based on universal male suffrage had been proclaimed.
In other parts of Europe where independent nation-states did not
yet exist – such as Germany, Italy, Poland, the Austro-Hungarian
Empire – men and women of the liberal middle classes combined
their demands for constitutionalism with national unification. They
took advantage of the growing popular unrest to push their
demands for the creation of a nation-state on parliamentary
principles – a constitution, freedom of the press and freedom
of association.
In the German regions a large number of political associations whose
members were middle-class professionals, businessmen and
prosperous artisans came together in the city of Frankfurt and decided
to vote for an all-German National Assembly. On 18 May 1848,
831 elected representatives marched in a festive procession to take
their places in the Frankfurt parliament convened in the Church of
St Paul. They drafted a constitution for a German nation to be
headed by a monarchy subject to a parliament. When the deputies
offered the crown on these terms to Friedrich Wilhelm IV, King of
Prussia, he rejected it and joined other monarchs to oppose the
elected assembly. While the opposition of the aristocracy and military
became stronger, the social basis of parliament eroded. The
parliament was dominated by the middle classes who resisted the
demands of workers and artisans and consequently lost their support.
In the end troops were called in and the assembly was forced
to disband.
The issue of extending political rights to women was a controversial
one within the liberal movement, in which large numbers of women
had participated actively over the years. Women had formed their
own political associations, founded newspapers and taken part in
political meetings and demonstrations. Despite this they were denied
How were liberty and equality for women
to be defined?
The liberal politician Carl Welcker, an elected
member of the Frankfurt Parliament, expressed
the following views:
‘Nature has created men and women to carry
out different functions … Man, the stronger, the
bolder and freer of the two, has been designated
as protector of the family, its provider, meant for
public tasks in the domain of law, production,
defence. Woman, the weaker, dependent and
timid, requires the protection of man. Her sphere
is the home, the care of the children, the
nurturing of the family … Do we require any
further proof that given such differences, equality
between the sexes would only endanger
harmony and destroy the dignity of the family?’
Louise Otto-Peters (1819-95) was a political
activist who founded a women’s journal and
subsequently a feminist political association. The
first issue of her newspaper (21 April 1849) carried
the following editorial:
‘Let us ask how many men, possessed by
thoughts of living and dying for the sake of Liberty,
would be prepared to fight for the freedom of
the entire people, of all human beings? When
asked this question, they would all too easily
respond with a “Yes!”, though their untiring
efforts are intended for the benefit of only one
half of humanity – men. But Liberty is indivisible!
Free men therefore must not tolerate to be
surrounded by the unfree …’
An anonymous reader of the same newspaper
sent the following letter to the editor on 25 June
1850:
‘It is indeed ridiculous and unreasonable to deny
women political rights even though they enjoy
the right to property which they make use
of. They perform functions and assume
responsibilities without however getting the
benefits that accrue to men for the same … Why
this injustice? Is it not a disgrace that even the
stupidest cattle-herder possesses the right
to vote, simply because he is a man, whereas
highly talented women owning considerable
property are excluded from this right, even
though they contribute so much to the
maintenance of the state?’ Source

Though conservative forces were able to suppress liberal movements
in 1848, they could not restore the old order. Monarchs were
beginning to realise that the cycles of revolution and repression could
only be ended by granting concessions to the liberal-nationalist
revolutionaries. Hence, in the years after 1848, the autocratic
monarchies of Central and Eastern Europe began to introduce the
changes that had already taken place in Western Europe before 1815.
Thus serfdom and bonded labour were abolished both in the
Habsburg dominions and in Russia. The Habsburg rulers granted
more autonomy to the Hungarians in 1867.

Nationalism in Europe
4 The Making of Germany and Italy
4.1 Germany – Can the Army be the Architect of a Nation?
After 1848, nationalism in Europe moved away from its association
with democracy and revolution. Nationalist sentiments were often
mobilised by conservatives for promoting state power and achieving
political domination over Europe.
This can be observed in the process by which Germany and Italy came
to be unified as nation-states. As you have seen, nationalist feelings were
widespread among middle-class Germans, who in 1848 tried to unite
the different regions of the German confederation into a nation-state
governed by an elected parliament. This liberal initiative to nation-building
was, however, repressed by the combined forces of the monarchy and
the military, supported by the large landowners (called Junkers) of Prussia.
From then on, Prussia took on the leadership of the movement for
national unification. Its chief minister, Otto von
Bismarck, was the architect of this process carried
out with the help of the Prussian army and
bureaucracy. Three wars over seven years – with
Austria, Denmark and France – ended in Prussian
victory and completed the process of unification.
In January 1871, the Prussian king, William I,
was proclaimed German Emperor in a ceremony
held at Versailles.
On the bitterly cold morning of 18 January 1871,
an assembly comprising the princes of the
German states, representatives of the army,
important Prussian ministers including the chief
minister Otto von Bismarck gathered in the
unheated Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles
to proclaim the new German Empire headed
by Kaiser William I of Prussia.
The nation-building process in Germany had
demonstrated the dominance of Prussian state
power. The new state placed a strong emphasis
on modernising the currency, banking, legal
and judicial systems in Germany. Prussian
measures and practices often became a model for
the rest of Germany.

4.2 Italy Unified
Like Germany, Italy too had a long history of political fragmentation.
Italians were scattered over several dynastic states as well as the
multi-national Habsburg Empire. During the middle of the
nineteenth century, Italy was divided into seven states, of which
only one, Sardinia-Piedmont, was ruled by an Italian princely house.
The north was under Austrian Habsburgs, the centre was ruled by
the Pope and the southern regions were under the domination
of the Bourbon kings of Spain. Even the Italian language had
not acquired one common form and still had many regional and
local variations.
During the 1830s, Giuseppe Mazzini had sought to put together a
coherent programme for a unitary Italian Republic. He had also
formed a secret society called Young Italy for the dissemination of
his goals. The failure of revolutionary uprisings both in 1831 and
1848 meant that the mantle now fell on Sardinia-Piedmont under
its ruler King Victor Emmanuel II to unify the Italian states through
war. In the eyes of the ruling elites of this region, a unified
Italy offered them the possibility of economic development and
political dominance.

Nationalism in Europe
Chief Minister Cavour who led the movement to unify the regions
of Italy was neither a revolutionary nor a democrat. Like many
other wealthy and educated members of the Italian elite, he spoke
French much better than he did Italian. Through a tactful diplomatic
alliance with France engineered by Cavour, Sardinia-Piedmont
succeeded in defeating the Austrian forces in 1859. Apart from regular
troops, a large number of armed volunteers under the leadership of
Giuseppe Garibaldi joined the fray. In 1860, they marched into South
Italy and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and succeeded in winning
the support of the local peasants in order to drive out the Spanish
rulers. In 1861 Victor Emmanuel II was proclaimed king of united
Italy. However, much of the Italian population, among whom rates
of illiteracy were very high, remained blissfully unaware of liberal-
nationalist ideology. The peasant masses who had supported Garibaldi
in southern Italy had never heard of Italia, and believed that ‘La Talia’
was Victor Emmanuel’s wife!

was not the result of a sudden upheaval or revolution. It was the
result of a long-drawn-out process. There was no British nation
prior to the eighteenth century. The primary identities of the people
who inhabited the British Isles were ethnic ones – such as English,
Welsh, Scot or Irish. All of these ethnic groups had their own cultural
and political traditions. But as the English nation steadily grew in
wealth, importance and power, it was able to extend its influence
over the other nations of the islands. The English parliament, which
had seized power from the monarchy in 1688 at the end of a
protracted conflict, was the instrument through which a nation-state,
with England at its centre, came to be forged. The Act of Union
(1707) between England and Scotland that resulted in the formation
of the ‘United Kingdom of Great Britain’ meant, in effect, that
England was able to impose its influence on Scotland. The British
parliament was henceforth dominated by its English members. The
growth of a British identity meant that Scotland’s distinctive culture
and political institutions were systematically suppressed. The Catholic
clans that inhabited the Scottish Highlands suffered terrible repression
whenever they attempted to assert their independence. The Scottish
Highlanders were forbidden to speak their Gaelic language or
wear their national dress, and large numbers were forcibly driven
out of their homeland.
Ireland suffered a similar fate. It was a country deeply divided
between Catholics and Protestants. The English helped the Protestants
of Ireland to establish their dominance over a largely Catholic country.
Catholic revolts against British dominance were suppressed. After a
failed revolt led by Wolfe Tone and his United Irishmen (1798),
Ireland was forcibly incorporated into the United Kingdom in 1801.
A new ‘British nation’ was forged through the propagation of a
dominant English culture. The symbols of the new Britain – the
British flag (Union Jack), the national anthem (God Save Our Noble
King), the English language – were actively promoted and the older
nations survived only as subordinate partners in this union.

Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-82) is perhaps the
most celebrated of Italian freedom fighters. He
came from a family engaged in coastal trade and
was a sailor in the merchant navy. In 1833 he
met Mazzini, joined the Young Italy movement
and participated in a republican uprising in
Piedmont in 1834. The uprising was suppressed
and Garibaldi had to flee to South America, where
he lived in exile till 1848. In 1854, he supported
Victor Emmanuel II in his efforts to unify the
Italian states. In 1860, Garibaldi led the famous
Expedition of the Thousand to South Italy. Fresh
volunteers kept joining through the course of
the campaign, till their numbers grew to about
30,000. They were popularly known as Red
Shirts.
In 1867, Garibaldi led an army of volunteers to
Rome to fight the last obstacle to the unification
of Italy, the Papal States where a French garrison
was stationed. The Red Shirts proved to be no
match for the combined French and Papal troops.
It was only in 1870 when, during the war with
Prussia, France withdrew its troops from Rome
that the Papal States were finally joined
to Italy.

Nationalism in Europe
5 Visualising the Nation
While it is easy enough to represent a ruler through a portrait or a
statue, how does one go about giving a face to a nation? Artists in
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries found a way out by
personifying a nation. In other words they represented a country as
if it were a person. Nations were then portrayed as female figures.
The female form that was chosen to personify the nation did not
stand for any particular woman in real life; rather it sought to give
the abstract idea of the nation a concrete form. That is, the female
figure became an allegory of the nation.
You will recall that during the French Revolution artists used the
female allegory to portray ideas such as Liberty, Justice and the
Republic. These ideals were represented through specific objects or
symbols. As you would remember, the attributes of Liberty are the
red cap, or the broken chain, while Justice is generally a blindfolded
woman carrying a pair of weighing scales.
Similar female allegories were invented by artists in the nineteenth
century to represent the nation. In France she was christened
Marianne, a popular Christian name, which underlined the idea of a
people’s nation. Her characteristics were drawn from those of Liberty
and the Republic – the red cap, the tricolour, the cockade. Statues
of Marianne were erected in public squares to remind the public of
the national symbol of unity and to persuade them to identify with
it. Marianne images were marked on coins and stamps.
Similarly, Germania became the allegory of the German nation. In
visual representations, Germania wears a crown of oak leaves, as
the German oak stands for heroism.

6 Nationalism and Imperialism
By the last quarter of the nineteenth century nationalism no longer
retained its idealistic liberal-democratic sentiment of the first half
of the century, but became a narrow creed with limited ends. During
this period nationalist groups became increasingly intolerant of each
other and ever ready to go to war. The major European powers, in
turn, manipulated the nationalist aspirations of the subject peoples
in Europe to further their own imperialist aims.
The most serious source of nationalist tension in Europe after 1871
was the area called the Balkans. The Balkans was a region of
geographical and ethnic variation comprising modern-day Romania,
Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, Macedonia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro whose inhabitants were broadly
known as the Slavs. A large part of the Balkans was under the control
of the Ottoman Empire. The spread of the ideas of romantic
nationalism in the Balkans together with the disintegration of the
Ottoman Empire made this region very explosive. All through the
nineteenth century the Ottoman Empire had sought to strengthen
itself through modernisation and internal reforms but with very
little success. One by one, its European subject nationalities broke
away from its control and declared independence. The Balkan
peoples based their claims for independence or political rights on
nationality and used history to prove that they had once been
independent but had subsequently been subjugated by foreign
powers. Hence the rebellious nationalities in the Balkans thought of
their struggles as attempts to win back their long-lost independence.
 As the different Slavic nationalities struggled to define their identity
and independence, the Balkan area became an area of intense conflict.
The Balkan states were fiercely jealous of each other and each hoped
to gain more territory at the expense of the others. Matters were
further complicated because the Balkans also became the scene of
big power rivalry. During this period, there was intense rivalry among
the European powers over trade and colonies as well as naval and
military might. These rivalries were very evident in the way the Balkan
problem unfolded. Each power – Russia, Germany, England,
Austro-Hungary – was keen on countering the hold of other powers
over the Balkans, and extending its own control over the area. This
led to a series of wars in the region and finally the First World War.

Nationalism in Europe
Nationalism, aligned with imperialism, led Europe to disaster in 1914.
But meanwhile, many countries in the world which had been
colonised by the European powers in the nineteenth century began
to oppose imperial domination. The anti-imperial movements that
developed everywhere were nationalist, in the sense that they all
struggled to form independent nation-states, and were inspired by
a sense of collective national unity, forged in confrontation with
imperialism. European ideas of nationalism were nowhere
replicated, for people everywhere developed their own specific variety
of nationalism. But the idea that societies should be organised into
‘nation-states’ came to be accepted as natural and universal.

1 The First World War, Khilafat and Non-Cooperation
In the years after 1919, we see the national movement spreading to
new areas, incorporating new social groups, and developing new
modes of struggle. How do we understand these developments?
What implications did they have?
First of all, the war created a new economic and political situation.
It led to a huge increase in defence expenditure which was financed
by war loans and increasing taxes: customs duties were raised and
income tax introduced. Through the war years prices increased –
doubling between 1913 and 1918 – leading to extreme hardship
for the common people. Villages were called upon to supply soldiers,
and the forced recruitment in rural areas caused widespread anger.
Then in 1918-19 and 1920-21, crops failed in many parts of India,
resulting in acute shortages of food. This was accompanied by an
influenza epidemic. According to the census of 1921, 12 to 13 million
people perished as a result of famines and the epidemic.
People hoped that their hardships would end after the war was
over. But that did not happen.
At this stage a new leader appeared and suggested a new mode
of struggle.
1.1 The Idea of Satyagraha
Mahatma Gandhi returned to India in January 1915. As you know,
he had come from South Africa where he had successfully fought

stopped and Gandhiji arrested,
thousands of more workers joined
the satyagraha against racist laws
that denied rights to non-whites.

the racist regime with a novel method of mass agitation, which he
called satyagraha. The idea of satyagraha emphasised the power of
truth and the need to search for truth. It suggested that if the cause
was true, if the struggle was against injustice, then physical force was
not necessary to fight the oppressor. Without seeking vengeance or
being aggressive, a satyagrahi could win the battle through non-
violence. This could be done by appealing to the conscience of the
oppressor. People – including the oppressors – had to be persuaded
to see the truth, instead of being forced to accept truth through the
use of violence. By this struggle, truth was bound to ultimately
triumph. Mahatma Gandhi believed that this dharma of non-violence
could unite all Indians.
After arriving in India, Mahatma Gandhi successfully organised
satyagraha movements in various places. In 1917 he travelled to
Champaran in Bihar to inspire the peasants to struggle against the
oppressive plantation system. Then in 1917, he organised a satyagraha
to support the peasants of the Kheda district of Gujarat. Affected
by crop failure and a plague epidemic, the peasants of Kheda could
not pay the revenue, and were demanding that revenue collection be
relaxed. In 1918, Mahatma Gandhi went to Ahmedabad to organise
a satyagraha movement amongst cotton mill workers.
1.2 The Rowlatt Act
Emboldened with this success, Gandhiji in 1919 decided to launch a
nationwide satyagraha against the proposed Rowlatt Act (1919). This
Act had been hurriedly passed through the Imperial Legislative
Council despite the united opposition of the Indian members. It
gave the government enormous powers to repress political activities,
and allowed detention of political prisoners without trial for two
years. Mahatma Gandhi wanted non-violent civil disobedience against
such unjust laws, which would start with a hartal on 6 April.
Rallies were organised in various cities, workers went on strike in
railway workshops, and shops closed down. Alarmed by the popular
upsurge, and scared that lines of communication such as the railways
and telegraph would be disrupted, the British administration decided
to clamp down on nationalists. Local leaders were picked up from
Amritsar, and Mahatma Gandhi was barred from entering Delhi.
On 10 April, the police in Amritsar fired upon a peaceful procession,
provoking widespread attacks on banks, post offices and railway
stations. Martial law was imposed and General Dyer took command.
Mahatma Gandhi on Satyagraha
‘It is said of “passive resistance” that it is the
weapon of the weak, but the power which is
the subject of this article can be used only
by the strong. This power is not passive
resistance; indeed it calls for intense activity. The
movement in South Africa was not passive
but active …
‘ Satyagraha is not physical force. A satyagrahi
does not inflict pain on the adversary; he does
not seek his destruction … In the use of
satyagraha, there is no ill-will whatever.
‘ Satyagraha is pure soul-force. Truth is the very
substance of the soul. That is why this force is
called satyagraha. The soul is informed with
knowledge. In it burns the flame of love. … Non-
violence is the supreme dharma …
‘It is certain that India cannot rival Britain or
Europe in force of arms. The British worship the
war-god and they can all of them become, as
they are becoming, bearers of arms. The
hundreds of millions in India can never carry arms.
They have made the religion of non-violence their
own ...’

On 13 April the infamous Jallianwalla Bagh incident took place. On
that day a large crowd gathered in the enclosed ground of Jallianwalla
Bagh. Some came to protest against the government’s new repressive
measures. Others had come to attend the annual Baisakhi fair. Being
from outside the city, many villagers were unaware of the martial
law that had been imposed. Dyer entered the area, blocked the exit
points, and opened fire on the crowd, killing hundreds. His object,
as he declared later, was to ‘produce a moral effect’, to create in the
minds of satyagrahis a feeling of terror and awe.
As the news of Jallianwalla Bagh spread, crowds took to the streets
in many north Indian towns. There were strikes, clashes with the
police and attacks on government buildings. The government
responded with brutal repression, seeking to humiliate and terrorise
people: satyagrahis were forced to rub their noses on the ground,
crawl on the streets, and do salaam (salute) to all sahibs; people were
flogged and villages (around Gujranwala in Punjab, now in Pakistan)
were bombed. Seeing violence spread, Mahatma Gandhi called off
the movement.
While the Rowlatt satyagraha had been a widespread movement, it
was still limited mostly to cities and towns. Mahatma Gandhi now felt
the need to launch a more broad-based movement in India. But he
was certain that no such movement could be organised without
bringing the Hindus and Muslims closer together. One way of doing
this, he felt, was to take up the Khilafat issue. The First World War had
ended with the defeat of Ottoman Turkey. And there were rumours
that a harsh peace treaty was going to be imposed on the Ottoman
emperor – the spiritual head of the Islamic world (the Khalifa). To
defend the Khalifa’s temporal powers, a Khilafat Committee was
formed in Bombay in March 1919. A young generation of Muslim
leaders like the brothers Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, began
discussing with Mahatma Gandhi about the possibility of a united
mass action on the issue. Gandhiji saw this as an opportunity to bring
Muslims under the umbrella of a unified national movement. At the
Calcutta session of the Congress in September 1920, he convinced
other leaders of the need to start a non-cooperation movement in
support of Khilafat as well as for swaraj.
1.3 Why Non-cooperation?
In his famous book Hind Swaraj (1909) Mahatma Gandhi declared
that British rule was established in India with the cooperation of

New words
Boycott – The refusal to deal and associate with
people, or participate in activities, or buy and
use things; usually a form of protest
Indians, and had survived only because of this cooperation. If Indians
refused to cooperate, British rule in India would collapse within a
year, and swaraj would come.
How could non-cooperation become a movement? Gandhiji
proposed that the movement should unfold in stages. It should begin
with the surrender of titles that the government awarded, and a
boycott of civil services, army, police, courts and legislative councils,
schools, and foreign goods. Then, in case the government used
repression, a full civil disobedience campaign would be launched.
Through the summer of 1920 Mahatma Gandhi and Shaukat Ali
toured extensively, mobilising popular support for the movement.
Many within the Congress were, however, concerned about the
proposals. They were reluctant to boycott the council elections
scheduled for November 1920, and they feared that the movement
might lead to popular violence. In the months between September
and December there was an intense tussle within the Congress. For a
while there seemed no meeting point between the supporters and
the opponents of the movement. Finally, at the Congress session at
Nagpur in December 1920, a compromise was worked out and
the Non-Cooperation programme was adopted.
How did the movement unfold? Who participated in it? How did
different social groups conceive of the idea of Non-Cooperation?

2 Differing Strands within the Movement
The Non-Cooperation-Khilafat Movement began in January 1921.
Various social groups participated in this movement, each with its
own specific aspiration. All of them responded to the call of Swaraj,
but the term meant different things to different people.
2.1 The Movement in the Towns
The movement started with middle-class participation in the cities.
Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and
colleges, headmasters and teachers resigned, and lawyers gave up
their legal practices. The council elections were boycotted in most
provinces except Madras, where the Justice Party, the party of the
non-Brahmans, felt that entering the council was one way of gaining
some power – something that usually only Brahmans had access to.
The effects of non-cooperation on the economic front were more
dramatic. Foreign goods were boycotted, liquor shops picketed,
and foreign cloth burnt in huge bonfires. The import of foreign
cloth halved between 1921 and 1922, its value dropping from
Rs 102 crore to Rs 57 crore. In many places merchants and traders
refused to trade in foreign goods or finance foreign trade. As the
boycott movement spread, and people began discarding imported
clothes and wearing only Indian ones, production of Indian textile
mills and handlooms went up.
But this movement in the cities gradually slowed down for a variety
of reasons. Khadi cloth was often more expensive than mass-
produced mill cloth and poor people could not afford to buy it.
How then could they boycott mill cloth for too long? Similarly the
boycott of British institutions posed a problem. For the movement
to be successful, alternative Indian institutions had to be set up
so that they could be used in place of the British ones. These were
slow to come up. So students and teachers began trickling
back to government schools and lawyers joined back work in
government courts.
2.2 Rebellion in the Countryside
From the cities, the Non-Cooperation Movement spread to the
countryside. It drew into its fold the struggles of peasants and tribals

which were developing in different parts of India in the years
after the war.
In Awadh, peasants were led by Baba Ramchandra – a sanyasi who
had earlier been to Fiji as an indentured labourer. The movement
here was against talukdars and landlords who demanded from
peasants exorbitantly high rents and a variety of other cesses. Peasants
had to do begar and work at landlords’ farms without any payment.
As tenants they had no security of tenure, being regularly evicted so
that they could acquire no right over the leased land. The peasant
movement demanded reduction of revenue, abolition of begar, and
social boycott of oppressive landlords. In many places nai – dhobi
bandhs were organised by panchayats to deprive landlords of the
services of even barbers and washermen. In June 1920, Jawaharlal
Nehru began going around the villages in Awadh, talking to the
villagers, and trying to understand their grievances. By October, the
Oudh Kisan Sabha was set up headed by Jawaharlal Nehru, Baba
Ramchandra and a few others. Within a month, over 300 branches
had been set up in the villages around the region. So when the Non-
Cooperation Movement began the following year, the effort of the
Congress was to integrate the Awadh peasant struggle into the wider
struggle. The peasant movement, however, developed in forms that
the Congress leadership was unhappy with. As the movement spread
in 1921, the houses of talukdars and merchants were attacked,
bazaars were looted, and grain hoards were taken over. In many
places local leaders told peasants that Gandhiji had declared that
no taxes were to be paid and land was to be redistributed among
the poor. The name of the Mahatma was being invoked to sanction
all action and aspirations.

On 6 January 1921, the police in United Provinces fired at peasants near Rae Bareli. Jawaharlal Nehru wanted to go to
the place of firing, but was stopped by the police. Agitated and angry, Nehru addressed the peasants who gathered
around him. This is how he later described the meeting:
‘They behaved as brave men, calm and unruffled in the face of danger. I do not know how they felt but I know what
my feelings were. For a moment my blood was up, non-violence was almost forgotten – but for a moment only. The
thought of the great leader, who by God’s goodness has been sent to lead us to victory, came to me, and I saw the
kisans seated and standing near me, less excited, more peaceful than I was – and the moment of weakness passed, I
spoke to them in all humility on non-violence – I needed the lesson more than they – and they heeded me and
peacefully dispersed.’

Tribal peasants interpreted the message of Mahatma Gandhi and
the idea of swaraj in yet another way. In the Gudem Hills of Andhra
Pradesh, for instance, a militant guerrilla movement spread in
the early 1920s – not a form of struggle that the Congress could
approve. Here, as in other forest regions, the colonial government
had closed large forest areas, preventing people from entering
the forests to graze their cattle, or to collect fuelwood and fruits.
This enraged the hill people. Not only were their livelihoods
affected but they felt that their traditional rights were being denied.
When the government began forcing them to contribute begar
for road building, the hill people revolted. The person who came
to lead them was an interesting figure. Alluri Sitaram Raju claimed
that he had a variety of special powers: he could make correct
astrological predictions and heal people, and he could survive
even bullet shots. Captivated by Raju, the rebels proclaimed that
he was an incarnation of God. Raju talked of the greatness of
Mahatma Gandhi, said he was inspired by the Non-Cooperation
Movement, and persuaded people to wear khadi and give up drinking.
But at the same time he asserted that India could be liberated only
by the use of force, not non-violence. The Gudem rebels attacked
police stations, attempted to kill British officials and carried on
guerrilla warfare for achieving swaraj. Raju was captured and
executed in 1924, and over time became a folk hero.
2.3 Swaraj in the Plantations
Workers too had their own understanding of Mahatma Gandhi
and the notion of swaraj. For plantation workers in Assam, freedom
meant the right to move freely in and out of the confined space in
which they were enclosed, and it meant retaining a link with the
village from which they had come. Under the Inland Emigration
Act of 1859, plantation workers were not permitted to leave the
tea gardens without permission, and in fact they were rarely given
such permission. When they heard of the Non-Cooperation
Movement, thousands of workers defied the authorities, left the
plantations and headed home. They believed that Gandhi Raj was
coming and everyone would be given land in their own villages.
They, however, never reached their destination. Stranded on the way
by a railway and steamer strike, they were caught by the police and
brutally beaten up.

The visions of these movements were not defined by the Congress
programme. They interpreted the term swaraj in their own ways,
imagining it to be a time when all suffering and all troubles would
be over. Yet, when the tribals chanted Gandhiji’s name and raised
slogans demanding ‘Swatantra Bharat’, they were also emotionally
relating to an all-India agitation. When they acted in the name of
Mahatma Gandhi, or linked their movement to that of the Congress,
they were identifying with a movement which went beyond the limits
of their immediate locality.

3 Towards Civil Disobedience
In February 1922, Mahatma Gandhi decided to withdraw the
Non-Cooperation Movement. He felt the movement was turning
violent in many places and satyagrahis needed to be properly trained
before they would be ready for mass struggles. Within the Congress,
some leaders were by now tired of mass struggles and wanted to
participate in elections to the provincial councils that had been set
up by the Government of India Act of 1919. They felt that it was
important to oppose British policies within the councils, argue for
reform and also demonstrate that these councils were not truly
democratic. C. R. Das and Motilal Nehru formed the Swaraj Party
within the Congress to argue for a return to council politics. But
younger leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose
pressed for more radical mass agitation and for full independence.
In such a situation of internal debate and dissension two factors
again shaped Indian politics towards the late 1920s. The first was
the effect of the worldwide economic depression. Agricultural prices
began to fall from 1926 and collapsed after 1930. As the demand
for agricultural goods fell and exports declined, peasants found it
difficult to sell their harvests and pay their revenue. By 1930, the
countryside was in turmoil.
Against this background the new Tory government in Britain
constituted a Statutory Commission under Sir John Simon. Set up
in response to the nationalist movement, the
commission was to look into the functioning of
the constitutional system in India and suggest
changes. The problem was that the commission
did not have a single Indian member. They were
all British.
When the Simon Commission arrived in India in
1928, it was greeted with the slogan ‘Go back
Simon’. All parties, including the Congress and the
Muslim League, participated in the demonstrations.
In an effort to win them over, the viceroy, Lord
Irwin, announced in October 1929, a vague offer
of ‘dominion status’ for India in an unspecified
future, and a Round Table Conference to discuss a
future constitution. This did not satisfy the Congress
leaders. The radicals within the Congress, led by

Nationalism in India
Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose, became more assertive.
The liberals and moderates, who were proposing a constitutional
system within the framework of British dominion, gradually lost
their influence. In December 1929, under the presidency of Jawaharlal
Nehru, the Lahore Congress formalised the demand of ‘Purna
Swaraj’ or full independence for India. It was declared that 26 January
1930, would be celebrated as the Independence Day when people
were to take a pledge to struggle for complete independence. But
the celebrations attracted very little attention. So Mahatma Gandhi
had to find a way to relate this abstract idea of freedom to more
concrete issues of everyday life.
3.1 The Salt March and the Civil Disobedience Movement
Mahatma Gandhi found in salt a powerful symbol that could unite
the nation. On 31 January 1930, he sent a letter to Viceroy Irwin
stating eleven demands. Some of these were of general interest;
others were specific demands of different classes, from industrialists
to peasants. The idea was to make the demands wide-ranging, so
that all classes within Indian society could identify with them and
everyone could be brought together in a united campaign. The most
stirring of all was the demand to abolish the salt tax. Salt was
something consumed by the rich and the poor alike, and it was one
of the most essential items of food. The tax on salt and the
government monopoly over its production, Mahatma Gandhi
declared, revealed the most oppressive face of British rule.
Mahatma Gandhi’s letter was, in a way, an ultimatum. If the
demands were not fulfilled by 11 March, the letter stated, the
Congress would launch a civil disobedience campaign. Irwin was
unwilling to negotiate. So Mahatma Gandhi started his famous
salt march accompanied by 78 of his trusted volunteers. The march
was over 240 miles, from Gandhiji’s ashram in Sabarmati to the
Gujarati coastal town of Dandi. The volunteers walked for 24 days,
about 10 miles a day. Thousands came to hear Mahatma Gandhi
wherever he stopped, and he told them what he meant by swaraj
and urged them to peacefully defy the British. On 6 April he reached
Dandi, and ceremonially violated the law, manufacturing salt by
boiling sea water.
This marked the beginning of the Civil Disobedience Movement.
How was this movement different from the Non-Cooperation
Movement? People were now asked not only to refuse cooperation
The Independence Day Pledge, 26 January
1930
‘We believe that it is the inalienable right of the
Indian people, as of any other people, to have
freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and
have the necessities of life, so that they may
have full opportunities of growth. We believe
also that if any government deprives a people of
these rights and oppresses them, the people
have a further right to alter it or to abolish it.
The British Government in India has not only
deprived the Indian people of their freedom but
has based itself on the exploitation of the masses,
and has ruined India economically, politically,
culturally, and spiritually. We believe, therefore,
that India must sever the British connection and
attain Purna Swaraj or Complete Independence.’

with the British, as they had done in 1921-22, but also to break
colonial laws. Thousands in different parts of the country broke
the salt law, manufactured salt and demonstrated in front of
government salt factories. As the movement spread, foreign cloth
was boycotted, and liquor shops were picketed. Peasants refused to
pay revenue and chaukidari taxes, village officials resigned, and in
many places forest people violated forest laws – going into Reserved
Forests to collect wood and graze cattle.
Worried by the developments, the colonial government began
arresting the Congress leaders one by one. This led to violent clashes
in many palaces. When Abdul Ghaffar Khan, a devout disciple of
Mahatma Gandhi, was arrested in April 1930, angry crowds
demonstrated in the streets of Peshawar, facing armoured cars and
police firing. Many were killed. A month later, when Mahatma
Gandhi himself was arrested, industrial workers in Sholapur attacked
police posts, municipal buildings, lawcourts and railway stations –
all structures that symbolised British rule. A frightened government
responded with a policy of brutal repression. Peaceful satyagrahis
were attacked, women and children were beaten, and about 100,000
people were arrested.
In such a situation, Mahatma Gandhi once again decided to call off
the movement and entered into a pact with Irwin on 5 March 1931.
By this Gandhi-Irwin Pact, Gandhiji consented to participate in a
Round Table Conference (the Congress had boycotted the first

Round Table Conference) in London and the government agreed to
release the political prisoners. In December 1931, Gandhiji went to
London for the conference, but the negotiations broke down and
he returned disappointed. Back in India, he discovered that the
government had begun a new cycle of repression. Ghaffar Khan
and Jawaharlal Nehru were both in jail, the Congress had been
declared illegal, and a series of measures had been imposed to prevent
meetings, demonstrations and boycotts. With great apprehension,
Mahatma Gandhi relaunched the Civil Disobedience Movement.
For over a year, the movement continued, but by 1934 it lost
its momentum.
3.2 How Participants saw the Movement
Let us now look at the different social groups that participated in the
Civil Disobedience Movement. Why did they join the movement?
What were their ideals? What did swaraj mean to them?
In the countryside, rich peasant communities – like the Patidars of
Gujarat and the Jats of Uttar Pradesh – were active in the movement.
Being producers of commercial crops, they were very hard hit by
the trade depression and falling prices. As their cash income
disappeared, they found it impossible to pay the government’s revenue
demand. And the refusal of the government to reduce the revenue
demand led to widespread resentment. These rich peasants became
enthusiastic supporters of the Civil Disobedience Movement,
organising their communities, and at times forcing reluctant members,
to participate in the boycott programmes. For them the fight for
swaraj was a struggle against high revenues. But they were deeply
disappointed when the movement was called off in 1931 without
the revenue rates being revised. So when the movement was restarted
in 1932, many of them refused to participate.
The poorer peasantry were not just interested in the lowering of the
revenue demand. Many of them were small tenants cultivating land
they had rented from landlords. As the Depression continued and
cash incomes dwindled, the small tenants found it difficult to pay
their rent. They wanted the unpaid rent to the landlord to be remitted.
They joined a variety of radical movements, often led by Socialists
and Communists. Apprehensive of raising issues that might upset
the rich peasants and landlords, the Congress was unwilling to support
‘no rent’ campaigns in most places. So the relationship between the
poor peasants and the Congress remained uncertain.
‘To the altar of this revolution we have
brought our youth as incense’
Many nationalists thought that the struggle
against the British could not be won through
non-violence. In 1928, the Hindustan Socialist
Republican Army (HSRA) was founded at a
meeting in Ferozeshah Kotla ground in Delhi.
Amongst its leaders were Bhagat Singh, Jatin
Das and Ajoy Ghosh. In a series of dramatic
actions in different parts of India, the HSRA
targeted some of the symbols of British power.
In April 1929, Bhagat Singh and Batukeswar
Dutta threw a bomb in the Legislative Assembly.
In the same year there was an attempt to blow
up the train that Lord Irwin was travelling in.
Bhagat Singh was 23 when he was tried and
executed by the colonial government. During
his trial, Bhagat Singh stated that he did not
wish to glorify ‘the cult of the bomb and pistol’
but wanted a revolution in society:
‘Revolution is the inalienable right of mankind.
Freedom is the imprescriptible birthright of all.
The labourer is the real sustainer of society …
To the altar of this revolution we have brought
our youth as incense, for no sacrifice is too
great for so magnificent a cause. We are
content. We await the advent of revolution.
Inquilab Zindabad!’

What about the business classes? How did they relate to the Civil
Disobedience Movement? During the First World War, Indian
merchants and industrialists had made huge profits and become
powerful (see Chapter 5). Keen on expanding their business, they
now reacted against colonial policies that restricted business activities.
They wanted protection against imports of foreign goods, and a
rupee-sterling foreign exchange ratio that would discourage imports.
To organise business interests, they formed the Indian Industrial
and Commercial Congress in 1920 and the Federation of the Indian
Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FICCI) in 1927. Led by
prominent industrialists like Purshottamdas Thakurdas and
G. D. Birla, the industrialists attacked colonial control over the Indian
economy, and supported the Civil Disobedience Movement when
it was first launched. They gave financial assistance and refused to
buy or sell imported goods. Most businessmen came to see swaraj
as a time when colonial restrictions on business would no longer
exist and trade and industry would flourish without constraints. But
after the failure of the Round Table Conference, business groups
were no longer uniformly enthusiastic. They were apprehensive of
the spread of militant activities, and worried about prolonged
disruption of business, as well as of the growing influence of
socialism amongst the younger members of the Congress.
The industrial working classes did not participate in the Civil
Disobedience Movement in large numbers, except in the Nagpur
region. As the industrialists came closer to the Congress, workers
stayed aloof. But in spite of that, some workers did participate in
the Civil Disobedience Movement, selectively adopting some of
the ideas of the Gandhian programme, like boycott of foreign
goods, as part of their own movements against low wages and
poor working conditions. There were strikes by railway workers in
1930 and dockworkers in 1932. In 1930 thousands of workers in
Chotanagpur tin mines wore Gandhi caps and participated in protest
rallies and boycott campaigns. But the Congress was reluctant to
include workers’ demands as part of its programme of struggle.
It felt that this would alienate industrialists and divide the anti-
imperial forces.
Another important feature of the Civil Disobedience Movement
was the large-scale participation of women. During Gandhiji’s salt
march, thousands of women came out of their homes to listen to
him. They participated in protest marches, manufactured salt, and

picketed foreign cloth and liquor shops. Many went to jail. In urban
areas these women were from high-caste families; in rural areas
they came from rich peasant households. Moved by Gandhiji’s call,
they began to see service to the nation as a sacred duty of women.
Yet, this increased public role did not necessarily mean any radical
change in the way the position of women was visualised. Gandhiji
was convinced that it was the duty of women to look after home
and hearth, be good mothers and good wives. And for a long time
the Congress was reluctant to allow women to hold any position
of authority within the organisation. It was keen only on their
symbolic presence.
3.3 The Limits of Civil Disobedience
Not all social groups were moved by the abstract concept of swaraj.
One such group was the nation’s ‘untouchables’, who from around
the 1930s had begun to call themselves dalit or oppressed. For
long the Congress had ignored the dalits, for fear of offending the
sanatanis, the conservative high-caste Hindus. But Mahatma Gandhi
declared that swaraj would not come for a hundred years if
untouchability was not eliminated. He called the ‘untouchables’ harijan,

or the children of God, organised satyagraha to secure them entry
into temples, and access to public wells, tanks, roads and schools.
He himself cleaned toilets to dignify the work of the bhangi (the
sweepers), and persuaded upper castes to change their heart and
give up ‘the sin of untouchability’. But many dalit leaders were keen
on a different political solution to the problems of the community.
They began organising themselves, demanding reserved seats in
educational institutions, and a separate electorate that would choose
dalit members for legislative councils. Political empowerment, they
believed, would resolve the problems of their social disabilities.
Dalit participation in the Civil Disobedience Movement was
therefore limited, particularly in the Maharashtra and Nagpur region
where their organisation was quite strong.
Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who organised the dalits into the Depressed
Classes Association in 1930, clashed with Mahatma Gandhi at
the second Round Table Conference by demanding separate
electorates for dalits. When the British government conceded
Ambedkar’s demand, Gandhiji began a fast unto death. He believed
that separate electorates for dalits would slow down the process of
their integration into society. Ambedkar ultimately accepted Gandhiji’s
position and the result was the Poona Pact of September 1932.
It gave the Depressed Classes (later to be known as the Schedule
Castes) reserved seats in provincial and central legislative councils,
but they were to be voted in by the general electorate. The dalit
movement, however, continued to be apprehensive of the Congress-
led national movement.
Some of the Muslim political organisations in India were also
lukewarm in their response to the Civil Disobedience Movement.
After the decline of the Non-Cooperation-Khilafat movement, a
large section of Muslims felt alienated from the Congress. From the
mid-1920s the Congress came to be more visibly associated with
openly Hindu religious nationalist groups like the Hindu Mahasabha.
As relations between Hindus and Muslims worsened, each
community organised religious processions with militant fervour,
provoking Hindu-Muslim communal clashes and riots in various
cities. Every riot deepened the distance between the two communities.
The Congress and the Muslim League made efforts to renegotiate
an alliance, and in 1927 it appeared that such a unity could be forged.
The important differences were over the question of representation
in the future assemblies that were to be elected. Muhammad Ali

Nationalism in India
Jinnah, one of the leaders of the Muslim League, was willing to give
up the demand for separate electorates, if Muslims were assured
reserved seats in the Central Assembly and representation in
proportion to population in the Muslim-dominated provinces (Bengal
and Punjab). Negotiations over the question of representation
continued but all hope of resolving the issue at the All Parties
Conference in 1928 disappeared when M.R. Jayakar of the Hindu
Mahasabha strongly opposed efforts at compromise.
When the Civil Disobedience Movement started there was thus
an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust between communities.
Alienated from the Congress, large sections of Muslims could not
respond to the call for a united struggle. Many Muslim leaders and
intellectuals expressed their concern about the status of Muslims
as a minority within India. They feared that the culture and identity
of minorities would be submerged under the domination of a
Hindu majority.
In 1930, Sir Muhammad Iqbal, as president of the Muslim League, reiterated the importance of separate electorates for
the Muslims as an important safeguard for their minority political interests. His statement is supposed to have provided the
intellectual justification for the Pakistan demand that came up in subsequent years. This is what he said:
‘I have no hesitation in declaring that if the principle that the Indian Muslim is entitled to full and free development on the
lines of his own culture and tradition in his own Indian home-lands is recognised as the basis of a permanent communal
settlement, he will be ready to stake his all for the freedom of India. The principle that each group is entitled to free
development on its own lines is not inspired by any feeling of narrow communalism … A community which is inspired by
feelings of ill-will towards other communities is low and ignoble. I entertain the highest respect for the customs, laws,
religions and social institutions of other communities. Nay, it is my duty according to the teachings of the Quran, even to
defend their places of worship, if need be. Yet I love the communal group which is the source of life and behaviour and
which has formed me what I am by giving me its religion, its literature, its thought, its culture and thereby its whole past
as a living operative factor in my present consciousness …
‘Communalism in its higher aspect, then, is indispensable to the formation of a harmonious whole in a country like India.
The units of Indian society are not territorial as in European countries … The principle of European democracy cannot be
applied to India without recognising the fact of communal groups. The Muslim demand for the creation of a Muslim India
within India is, therefore, perfectly justified…
‘The Hindu thinks that separate electorates are contrary to the spirit of true nationalism, because he understands the
word “nation” to mean a kind of universal amalgamation in which no communal entity ought to retain its private individuality.
Such a state of things, however, does not exist. India is a land of racial and religious variety. Add to this the general
economic inferiority of the Muslims, their enormous debt, especially in the Punjab, and their insufficient majorities in some
of the provinces, as at present constituted and you will begin to see clearly the meaning of our anxiety to retain separate
electorates.’

4 The Sense of Collective Belonging
Nationalism spreads when people begin to believe that they are all
part of the same nation, when they discover some unity that binds
them together. But how did the nation become a reality in the minds
of people? How did people belonging to different communities,
regions or language groups develop a sense of collective belonging?
This sense of collective belonging came partly through the experience
of united struggles. But there were also a variety of cultural processes
through which nationalism captured people’s imagination. History
and fiction, folklore and songs, popular prints and symbols, all played
a part in the making of nationalism.

Nationalism in India
The identity of the nation, as you know (see Chapter 1), is most
often symbolised in a figure or image. This helps create an image
with which people can identify the nation. It was in the twentieth
century, with the growth of nationalism, that the identity of India
came to be visually associated with the image of Bharat Mata. The
image was first created by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. In the
1870s he wrote ‘Vande Mataram’ as a hymn to the motherland.
Later it was included in his novel Anandamath and widely sung during
the Swadeshi movement in Bengal. Moved by the Swadeshi
movement, Abanindranath Tagore painted his famous image of
Bharat Mata (see Fig. 12). In this painting Bharat Mata is portrayed
as an ascetic figure; she is calm, composed, divine and spiritual.
In subsequent years, the image of Bharat Mata acquired many
different forms, as it circulated in popular prints, and was painted
by different artists (see Fig. 14). Devotion to this mother figure came
to be seen as evidence of one’s nationalism.
Ideas of nationalism also developed through a movement to revive
Indian folklore. In late-nineteenth-century India, nationalists began
recording folk tales sung by bards and they toured villages to gather
folk songs and legends. These tales, they believed, gave a true picture
of traditional culture that had been corrupted and damaged by
outside forces. It was essential to preserve this folk tradition in
order to discover one’s national identity and restore a sense of pride
in one’s past. In Bengal, Rabindranath Tagore himself began collecting
ballads, nursery rhymes and myths, and led the movement for folk
Fig. 12 – Bharat Mata, Abanindranath Tagore,
1905.
Notice that the mother figure here is shown as
dispensing learning, food and clothing. The mala

Abanindranath Tagore, like Ravi Varma before
him, tried to develop a style of painting that
could be seen as truly Indian.

Nehru is here shown holding the image of Bharat Mata and the map of India
close to his heart. In a lot of popular prints, nationalist leaders are shown
offering their heads to Bharat Mata. The idea of sacrifice for the mother was
powerful within popular imagination.

‘In earlier times, foreign travellers in India marvelled at the courage, truthfulness and modesty of the people of the Arya
vamsa; now they remark mainly on the absence of those qualities. In those days Hindus would set out on conquest and
hoist their flags in Tartar, China and other countries; now a few soldiers from a tiny island far away are lording it over the
land of India.’

revival. In Madras, Natesa Sastri published a massive four-volume
collection of Tamil folk tales, The Folklore of Southern India. He believed
that folklore was national literature; it was ‘the most trustworthy
manifestation of people’s real thoughts and characteristics’.
As the national movement developed, nationalist leaders became
more and more aware of such icons and symbols in unifying people
and inspiring in them a feeling of nationalism. During the Swadeshi
movement in Bengal, a tricolour flag (red, green and yellow) was
designed. It had eight lotuses representing eight provinces of British
India, and a crescent moon, representing Hindus and Muslims. By
1921, Gandhiji had designed the Swaraj flag. It was again a tricolour
(red, green and white) and had a spinning wheel in the centre,
representing the Gandhian ideal of self-help. Carrying the flag,
holding it aloft, during marches became a symbol of defiance.
Another means of creating a feeling of nationalism was through
reinterpretation of history. By the end of the nineteenth century
many Indians began feeling that to instill a sense of pride in the
nation, Indian history had to be thought about differently. The British
saw Indians as backward and primitive, incapable of governing
themselves. In response, Indians began looking into the past to
discover India’s great achievements. They wrote about the glorious
developments in ancient times when art and architecture, science
and mathematics, religion and culture, law and philosophy, crafts
and trade had flourished. This glorious time, in their view, was
followed by a history of decline, when India was colonised. These
nationalist histories urged the readers to take pride in India’s great
achievements in the past and struggle to change the miserable
conditions of life under British rule.
These efforts to unify people were not without problems. When the
past being glorified was Hindu, when the images celebrated were
drawn from Hindu iconography, then people of other communities
felt left out.

This figure of Bharat Mata is a contrast to the
one painted by Abanindranath Tagore. Here she
is shown with a trishul, standing beside a lion

Nationalism in India
Conclusion
A growing anger against the colonial government was thus
bringing together various groups and classes of Indians into a
common struggle for freedom in the first half of the twentieth
century. The Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi
tried to channel people’s grievances into organised movements
for independence. Through such movements the nationalists
tried to forge a national unity. But as we have seen, diverse groups
and classes participated in these movements with varied aspirations
and expectations. As their
grievances were wide-ranging,
freedom from colonial rule also
meant different things to
different people. The Congress
continuously attempted to
resolve differences, and ensure
that the demands of one group
did not alienate another. This is
precisely why the unity within
the movement often broke down.
The high points of Congress
activity and nationalist unity
were followed by phases of
disunity and inner conflict
between groups.
In other words, what was emerging was a nation with many
voices wanting freedom from colonial rule.
Quit India Movement
The failure of the Cripps Mission and the effects of World War II created widespread discontentment in India. This
led Gandhiji to launch a movement calling for complete withdrawal of the British from India. The Congress Working
Committee, in its meeting in Wardha on 14 July 1942, passed the historic ‘Quit India’ resolution demanding the
immediate transfer of power to Indians and quit India. On 8 August 1942 in Bombay, the All India Congress Committee
endorsed the resolution which called for a non-violent mass struggle on the widest possible scale throughout the
country. It was on this occasion that Gandhiji delivered the famous ‘Do or Die’ speech. The call for ‘Quit India’ almost
brought the state machinery to a standstill in large parts of the country as people voluntarily threw themselves into
the thick of the movement. People observed hartals, and demonstrations and processions were accompanied by
national songs and slogans. The movement was truly a mass movement which brought into its ambit thousands of
ordinary people, namely students, workers and peasants. It also saw the active participation of leaders, namely,
Jayprakash Narayan, Aruna Asaf Ali and Ram Manohar Lohia and many women such as Matangini Hazra in Bengal,
Kanaklata Barua in Assam and Rama Devi in Odisha. The British responded with much force, yet it took more than a
year to suppress the movement.

The Making of a Global World
1 The Pre-modern World
When we talk of ‘globalisation’ we often refer to an economic
system that has emerged since the last 50 years or so. But as you will
see in this chapter, the making of the global world has a long
history – of trade, of migration, of people in search of work, the
movement of capital, and much else. As we think about the dramatic
and visible signs of global interconnectedness in our lives today,
we need to understand the phases through which this world in
which we live has emerged.
All through history, human societies have become steadily more
interlinked. From ancient times, travellers, traders, priests and
pilgrims travelled vast distances for knowledge, opportunity and
spiritual fulfilment, or to escape persecution. They carried goods,
money, values, skills, ideas, inventions, and even germs and diseases.
As early as 3000 BCE an active coastal trade linked the Indus valley
civilisations with present-day West Asia. For more than a millennia,
cowries (the Hindi cowdi or seashells, used as a form of currency)
from the Maldives found their way to China and East Africa. The
long-distance spread of disease-carrying germs may be traced as
far back as the seventh century. By the thirteenth century it had
become an unmistakable link.

1.1 Silk Routes Link the World
The silk routes are a good example of vibrant pre-modern trade
and cultural links between distant parts of the world. The name ‘silk
routes’ points to the importance of West-bound Chinese silk cargoes
along this route. Historians have identified several silk routes, over
land and by sea, knitting together vast regions of Asia, and linking
Asia with Europe and northern Africa. They are known to have
existed since before the Christian Era and thrived almost till the
fifteenth century. But Chinese pottery also travelled the same route,
as did textiles and spices from India and Southeast Asia. In return,
precious metals – gold and silver – flowed from Europe to Asia.
Trade and cultural exchange always went hand in hand. Early
Christian missionaries almost certainly travelled this route to Asia, as
did early Muslim preachers a few centuries later. Much before all
this, Buddhism emerged from eastern India and spread in several
directions through intersecting points on the silk routes.
1.2 Food Travels: Spaghetti and Potato
Food offers many examples of long-distance cultural exchange.
Traders and travellers introduced new crops to the lands they
travelled. Even ‘ready’ foodstuff in distant parts of the world might
share common origins. Take spaghetti and noodles. It is believed
that noodles travelled west from China to
become spaghetti. Or, perhaps Arab traders
took pasta to fifth-century Sicily, an island now
in Italy. Similar foods were also known in India
and Japan, so the truth about their origins may
never be known. Yet such guesswork suggests
the possibilities of long-distance cultural contact
even in the pre-modern world.
Many of our common foods such as potatoes,
soya, groundnuts, maize, tomatoes, chillies,
sweet potatoes, and so on were not known to
our ancestors until about five centuries ago.
These foods were only introduced in Europe
and Asia after Christopher Columbus
accidentally discovered the vast continent that
would later become known as the Americas.

The Making of a Global World
(Here we will use ‘America’ to describe North America, South
America and the Caribbean.) In fact, many of our common foods
came from America’s original inhabitants – the American Indians.
Sometimes the new crops could make the difference between life
and death. Europe’s poor began to eat better and live longer with
the introduction of the humble potato. Ireland’s poorest peasants
became so dependent on potatoes that when disease destroyed the
potato crop in the mid-1840s, hundreds of thousands died
of starvation.
1.3 Conquest, Disease and Trade
The pre-modern world shrank greatly in the sixteenth century after
European sailors found a sea route to Asia and also successfully
crossed the western ocean to America. For centuries before, the
Indian Ocean had known a bustling trade, with goods, people,
knowledge, customs, etc. criss-crossing its waters. The Indian
subcontinent was central to these flows and a crucial point in their
networks. The entry of the Europeans helped expand or redirect
some of these flows towards Europe.
Before its ‘discovery’, America had been cut off from regular contact
with the rest of the world for millions of years. But from the sixteenth
century, its vast lands and abundant crops and minerals began to
transform trade and lives everywhere.
Precious metals, particularly silver, from mines located in present-
day Peru and Mexico also enhanced Europe’s wealth and financed
its trade with Asia. Legends spread in seventeenth-century Europe
about South America’s fabled wealth. Many expeditions set off in
search of El Dorado, the fabled city of gold.
The Portuguese and Spanish conquest and colonisation of America
was decisively under way by the mid-sixteenth century. European
conquest was not just a result of superior firepower. In fact, the
most powerful weapon of the Spanish conquerors was not a
conventional military weapon at all. It was the germs such as those
of smallpox that they carried on their person. Because of their long
isolation, America’s original inhabitants had no immunity against
these diseases that came from Europe. Smallpox in particular proved
a deadly killer. Once introduced, it spread deep into the continent,
ahead even of any Europeans reaching there. It killed and decimated
whole communities, paving the way for conquest.

number emigrated in search of work.
‘Biological’ warfare?
John Winthorp, the first governor of the
Massachusetts Bay colony in New England,
wrote in May 1634 that smallpox signalled God’s
blessing for the colonists: ‘… the natives … were
neere (near) all dead of small Poxe (pox), so as
the Lord hathe (had) cleared our title to what
we possess’.

Guns could be bought or captured and turned against the invaders.
But not diseases such as smallpox to which the conquerors were
mostly immune.
Until the nineteenth century, poverty and hunger were common in
Europe. Cities were crowded and deadly diseases were widespread.
Religious conflicts were common, and religious dissenters were
persecuted. Thousands therefore fled Europe for America. Here,
by the eighteenth century, plantations worked by slaves captured
in Africa were growing cotton and sugar for European markets.
Until well into the eighteenth century, China and India were among
the world’s richest countries. They were also pre-eminent in Asian
trade. However, from the fifteenth century, China is said to have
restricted overseas contacts and retreated into isolation. China’s
reduced role and the rising importance of the Americas gradually
moved the centre of world trade westwards. Europe now emerged
as the centre of world trade.

The Making of a Global World
The world changed profoundly in the nineteenth century. Economic,
political, social, cultural and technological factors interacted in
complex ways to transform societies and reshape external relations.
Economists identify three types of movement or ‘flows’ within
international economic exchanges. The first is the flow of trade which
in the nineteenth century referred largely to trade in goods (e.g.,
cloth or wheat). The second is the flow of labour – the migration
of people in search of employment. The third is the movement of
capital for short-term or long-term investments over long distances.
All three flows were closely interwoven and affected peoples’ lives
more deeply now than ever before. The interconnections could
sometimes be broken – for example, labour migration was often
more restricted than goods or capital flows. Yet it helps us understand
the nineteenth-century world economy better if we look at the
three flows together.
2.1 A World Economy Takes Shape
A good place to start is the changing pattern of food production
and consumption in industrial Europe. Traditionally, countries liked
to be self-sufficient in food. But in nineteenth-century Britain,
self-sufficiency in food meant lower living standards and social
conflict. Why was this so?
Population growth from the late eighteenth century had increased
the demand for food grains in Britain. As urban centres expanded
and industry grew, the demand for agricultural products went
up, pushing up food grain prices. Under pressure from landed
groups, the government also restricted the import of corn. The
laws allowing the government to do this were commonly known as
the ‘Corn Laws’. Unhappy with high food prices, industrialists and
urban dwellers forced the abolition of the Corn Laws.
After the Corn Laws were scrapped, food could be imported into
Britain more cheaply than it could be produced within the country.
British agriculture was unable to compete with imports. Vast areas
of land were now left uncultivated, and thousands of men and
women were thrown out of work. They flocked to the cities or
migrated overseas.

As food prices fell, consumption in Britain rose. From the mid-
nineteenth century, faster industrial growth in Britain also led to higher
incomes, and therefore more food imports. Around the world – in
Eastern Europe, Russia, America and Australia – lands were cleared
and food production expanded to meet the British demand.
It was not enough merely to clear lands for agriculture. Railways
were needed to link the agricultural regions to the ports. New
harbours had to be built and old ones expanded to ship the new
cargoes. People had to settle on the lands to bring them under
cultivation. This meant building homes and settlements. All these
activities in turn required capital and labour. Capital flowed from
financial centres such as London. The demand for labour in places
where labour was in short supply – as in America and Australia –
led to more migration.
Nearly 50 million people emigrated from Europe to America and
Australia in the nineteenth century. All over the world some 150
million are estimated to have left their homes, crossed oceans and
vast distances over land in search of a better future.
